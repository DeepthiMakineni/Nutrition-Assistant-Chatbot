Pregnant women need adequate food and health care\\nto deliver a healthy baby who has a good birth weight and a fighting chance\\nfor survival. In many regions of the world, the infant mortality rate is very\\nhigh, meaning that many infants will not live to see their first birthday.\\nBreastfeeding is the ideal method of feeding and nurturing infants, because\\nbreast milk contains many immunologic agents that protect the infant against\\nbacteria, viruses, and parasites. Yet, less than 40 percent of infants world-\\nwide are exclusively breastfed (no other food or drink, not even water) for\\nthe first four months of life. Children need adequate nutrition to develop\\nand grow to their full potential.\\nMalnutrition, both undernutrition and overnutrition, is at an all time\\nhigh, with close to one-third of the world’s children suffering from it. The\\nnumber of undernourished people in the world continues to increase be-\\ncause of little or no progress to reduce poverty. Thousands of children die\\ndaily from hunger and its effects, even in technologically advanced coun-\\ntries. Without adequate nutrition, a person’s cognitive ability is diminished,\\nwhich adversely affects their ability to get a good paying job and contribute\\nto their local economy. Paradoxically, childhood and adult obesity in many\\nparts of the developed world are also near epidemic proportions. There\\nare 300 million obese people in the world. In the United States, about 34\\npercent of Americans are overweight and 30.5 percent are obese.\\nLife expectancy has increased in many countries and the population of\\nolder adults is growing at an unprecedented rate in the United States and\\nother technologically advanced countries. In the United States the average\\nlife expectancy is 70, while globally, the average rose to 67 years in 1998,\\nup from 61 in 1980. These countries are unsure of how they will provide\\nadequate health care for this growing segment of the population. Cardio-\\nvascular disease (coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke) and cancer\\nare top killers in many countries and HIV/AIDS continue to ravage our\\nsocieties, taking individuals in the productive years of their lives.\\nArrangement of the Material\\nNutrition and Well-Being A to Z is a two-volume set that provides timely\\ninformation on the personal, cultural, and global issues that affect (or have\\nan impact on) health and nutritional status. Users will find detailed cover-\\nage of topics covered in general nutrition, food science, and personal and\\nPreface'),\n",

This encyclopedia explains fundamental concepts such as\\namino acids, cutting-edge ideas such as functional foods, social issues such\\nas food insecurity, and political issues such as bioterrorism.\\nThe set was also designed to meet consumer needs. Users will be able\\nto spot a quack health-care provider, discriminate between reliable and\\nunreliable health claims, as well as understand the role of government in\\nkeeping food safe. The set also profiles individuals who have made a social,\\nhistorical, or scientific impact on health, nutrition, and food trends. Most\\nentries are written from a global perspective, and dietary patterns from dif-\\nferent regions of the world are discussed. Many professional health organi-\\nzations are described.\\nThe information in Nutrition and Well-Being A to Z is clearly presented\\nand easy to find. Professionals in the field of nutrition, dietetics, food sci-\\nence, agriculture, medicine, health education, and public health wrote with\\nthe student in mind. Students and teachers can use the set to reinforce\\nclassroom topics on food, nutrition, and health, and to expand discussions\\non special or new topics. The extensive use of illustrations enhances the\\nlearning of the material. Entries are arranged alphabetically and an exten-\\nsive cross-referencing system encourages the user to further explore other\\nentries. All topics in a volume can be found in the index at the back of\\nthe book.\\nAcknowledgements and Thanks\\nA project of this magnitude would not be possible without the dedication\\nand hard work of many people. I wish to thank the associate editors, Dr.\\nCatherine Christie and Dr. Ranjita Misra, for the many hours they spent\\nrecruiting authors and editing entries. Thank you for your timely turnaround\\nof the materials. The project would not have been possible without the\\nmany authors who wrote, and sometimes rewrote, the entries. Thank you\\nfor sharing your expertise and time. Amanda Foote, Senior Secretary in the\\nDepartment of Health Science Education, was extremely valuable in copy-\\ning and mailing the edited materials to the publishers. I wish to thank the\\nmany people at Macmillan Reference USA and the Gale Group for con-\\nceiving the project and providing direction throughout the entire project,\\nespecially the copyeditors and illustrators.

Although this term\\nis used to describe intense cravings to seek out specific foods, these foods\\nare not, in and of themselves, physically addictive in the way a drug might\\nbe. Instead, the need to pursue and consume these foods may be represen-\\ntative of a psychologicaldisturbance, extreme anxiety, or emotional dis-\\ntress.

New York: Facts on File.\\nAdditives and Preservatives\\nAdditives are defined by the United States Food and Drug Administration\\n(FDA) as “any substance, the intended use of which results or may reason-\\nably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in its becoming a compo-\\nnent or otherwise affecting the characteristics of any food.” In other words,\\nan additive is any substance that is added to food. Direct additives are those\\nthat are intentionally added to foods for a specific purpose. Indirect addi-\\ntives are those to which the food is exposed during processing, packaging,\\nor storing. Preservatives are additives that inhibit the growth of bacteria,\\nyeasts, and molds in foods.\\nAdditives and preservatives have been used in foods for centuries. When\\nmeats are smoked to preserve them, compounds such as butylated hydroxy-\\nanisole (BHA) and butyl gallate are formed and provide both antioxidant\\nand bacteriostatic effects. Salt has also been used as a preservative for cen-\\nturies. Salt lowers the water activity of meats and other foods and inhibits\\nbacterial growth. Excess water in foods can enhance the growth of bacteria,\\nyeast, and fungi. Pickling, which involves the addition of acids such as vine-\\ngar, lowers the pH of foods to levels that retard bacterial growth. Some\\nherbs and spices, such as curry, cinnamon, and chili pepper, also contain an-\\ntioxidants and may provide bactericidal effects.\\nA\\npsychological: related to thoughts, feel-\\nings, and personal experiences\\nanxiety: nervousness\\nbacteria: single-celled organisms without\\nnuclei, some of which are infectious\\nantioxidant: substance that prevents oxi-\\ndation, a damaging reaction with oxygen\\nbacteriostatic: a state that prevents\\ngrowth of bacteria\\npH: level of acidity, with low numbers in-\\ndicating high acidity\\nbactericidal: a substance that kills \\nbacteria'),\n",

Food additives may be classified as: \\n1. Antimicrobial agents, which prevent spoilage of food by mold or micro-\\norganisms. These include not only vinegar and salt, but also com-\\npounds such as calcium propionate and sorbic acid, which are used in\\nproducts such as baked goods, salad dressings, cheeses, margarines, and\\npickled foods.\\n2. Antioxidants, which prevent rancidity in foods containing fats and dam-\\nage to foods caused by oxygen. Examples of antioxidants include vit-\\namin C, vitamin E, BHA, BHT (butylated hydroxytolene), and propyl\\ngallate.\\n3. Artificial colors, which are intended to make food more appealing and\\nto provide certain foods with a color that humans associate with a par-\\nticular flavor (e.g., red for cherry, green for lime).\\n4. Artificial flavors and flavor enhancers, the largest class of additives, func-\\ntion to make food taste better, or to give them a specific taste. Examples\\nare salt, sugar, and vanilla, which are used to complement the fla-\\nvor of certain foods. Synthetic flavoring agents, such as benzaldehyde\\nfor cherry or almond flavor, may be used to simulate natural flavors.\\nFlavor enhancers, such as monosodium glutamate (MSG) intensify the\\nflavor of other compounds in a food.\\n5. Bleaching agents, such as peroxides, are used to whiten foods such as\\nwheat flour and cheese.\\n6. Chelating agents, which are used to prevent discoloration, flavor\\nchanges, and rancidity that might occur during the processing of foods.\\nExamples are citric acid, malic acid, and tartaric acid.\\n7. Nutrient additives, including vitamins and minerals, are added to foods\\nduring enrichmentor fortification. For example, milk is fortified with\\nvitamin D, and rice is enriched with thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin.\\n8. Thickening and stabilizing agents, which function to alter the texture of\\na food. Examples include the emulsifier lecithin, which, keeps oil and\\nvinegar blended in salad dressings, and carrageen, which is used as a\\nthickener in ice creams and low-calorie jellies.\\nRegulating Safety of Food Additives and Preservatives\\nBased on the 1958 Food Additives Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug,\\nand Cosmetic (FD&C) Act of 1938, the FDA must approve the use of all\\nadditives. The manufacturer bears the responsibility of proving that the ad-\\nditive is safe for its intended use. The Food Additives Amendment excluded\\nadditives and preservatives deemed safe for consumption prior to 1958, such\\nas salt, sugar, spices, vitamins, vinegar, and monosodium glutamate. These\\nsubstances are considered “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) and may\\nbe used in any food, though the FDA may remove additives from the GRAS\\nlist if safety concerns arise. The 1960 Color Additives Amendment to the\\nFD&C Act required the FDA to approve synthetic coloring agents used in\\n2\\nAdditives and Preservatives\\nleavening: yeast or other agents used\\nfor rising bread\\nfood additive: substance added to foods\\nto improve nutrition, taste, appearance,\\nor shelf-life\\nmicroorganisms: bacteria and protists;\\nsingle-celled organisms\\noxygen: O2, atmospheric gas required\\nby all animals\\nnutrient: dietary substance necessary\\nfor health\\nvitamin: necessary complex nutrient\\nused to aid enzymes or other metabolic\\nprocesses in the cell\\nmineral: an inorganic (non-carbon-\\ncontaining) element, ion, or compound\\nenrichment:addition of vitamins and\\nminerals to improve the nutritional con-\\ntent of a food\\nfortification: addition of vitamins and\\nminerals to improve the nutritional con-\\ntent of a food\\nfortified: altered by addition of vitamins\\nor minerals\\nvitamin D:nutrient needed for calcium\\nuptake and therefore proper bone forma-\\ntion\\nniacin: one of the B vitamins, required\\nfor energy production in the cell'),\n",

The flavoring enhancer MSG is\\nanother controversial food additive. MSG is made commercially from a nat-\\nural fermentation process using starch and sugar. Despite anecdotal reports\\nof MSG triggering headaches or exacerbating asthma, the Joint Expert\\nCommittee on Food Additives of the United Nations Food and Agriculture\\nOrganization, the World Health Organization, the European Community’s\\nScientific Committee for Food, the American Medical Association, and the\\nNational Academy of Sciences have all affirmed the safety of MSG at nor-\\nmal consumption levels.\\nIn the United States, food additives and preservatives play an important\\nrole in ensuring that the food supply remains the safest and most abundant in\\nthe world. A major task of the FDA is to regulate the use and approval of thou-\\nsands of approved food additives, and to evaluate their safety. Despite con-\\nsumer concern about use of food additives and preservatives, there is very little\\nscientific evidence that they are harmful at the levels at which they are used.\\nIn Europe, food additives and preservatives are evaluated by the Euro-\\npean Commission’s Scientific Committee on Food. Regulations in Euro-\\npean Union countries are similar to those in the United States. The Food\\nand Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World\\nHealth Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives work\\ntogether to evaluate the safety of food additives, as well as contaminants,\\nnaturally occurring toxicants, and residues of veterinary drugs in foods.

It\\nis one of the fastest growth periods of a person’s life. During this time, phys-\\nical changes affect the body’s nutritional needs, while changes in one’s\\nlifestyle may affect eating habits and food choices. Nutritional health dur-\\ning adolescence is important for supporting the growing body and for pre-\\nventing future health problems.\\nIncreased Nutritional Needs\\nThe physical changes of adolescence have a direct influence on a person’s\\nnutritional needs. Teenagers need additional calories, protein, calcium,\\nand iron.\\nCalories. Adolescents need additional calories to provide energy for\\ngrowth and activity. Boys ages 11 to 18 need between 2,500 and 2,800 calo-\\nries each day. Adolescent girls need approximately 2,200 calories each day.\\nThis is a significant increase from childhood requirements. To meet these\\ncalorie needs, teens should choose a variety of healthful foods, such as lean\\nprotein sources, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.\\nProtein. Protein is important for growth and maintenance of muscle. Ado-\\nlescents need between 45 and 60 grams of protein each day. Most teens eas-\\nily meet this requirement with their intake of beef, pork, chicken, eggs, and\\ndairy products. Protein is also available from certain vegetable sources, in-\\ncluding tofu and other soy foods, beans, and nuts.\\nCalcium. Adequate calcium intake is essential for development of strong\\nand dense bones during the adolescent growth spurt. Inadequate calcium\\nintake during adolescence and young adulthood puts individuals at risk for\\ndeveloping osteoporosis later in life. In order to get the required 1,200 mil-\\nligrams of calcium, teens are encouraged to consume three to four servings\\nof calcium-rich foods each day. Good sources include milk, yogurt, cheese,\\ncalcium-fortified juices, and calcium-fortified cereals.\\nIron. As adolescents gain muscle mass, more iron is needed to help their\\nnew muscle cells obtain oxygen for energy. A deficiency of iron causes ane-\\nmia, which leads to fatigue, confusion, and weakness. Adolescent boys need\\n12 milligrams of iron each day, while girls need 15 milligrams. Good sources\\nof iron include beef, chicken, pork, legumes (including beans and peanuts),\\nenriched or whole grains, and leafy green vegetables such as spinach, col-\\nlards, and kale.\\nEating and Snacking Patterns\\nAdolescents tend to eat differently than they did as children. With after-\\nschool activities and active social lives, teens are not always able to sit down\\nfor three meals a day. Busy schedules may lead to meal skipping, snacking\\nthroughout the day, and more eating away from home. Many teens skip\\nbreakfast, for example, but this meal is particularly important for getting\\nenough energy to make it through the day, and it may even lead to better\\nacademic performance. When teens skip meals, they are more likely to grab\\nfast food from a restaurant, vending machine, or convenience store. These\\nfoods are high in fat and sugar and tend to provide little nutritional value.\\nIn addition, eating too many fast foods can lead to weight gain and, in some\\ncases, diabetes and heart disease.\\n5\\nAdolescent Nutrition\\ndiabetes: inability to regulate level of\\nsugar in the blood\\nheart disease: any disorder of the heart\\nor its blood supply, including heart attack,\\natherosclerosis, and coronary artery \\ndisease\\ncalorie: unit of food energy\\nprotein: complex molecule composed of\\namino acids that performs vital functions\\nin the cell; necessary part of the diet\\ncalcium: mineral essential for bones and\\nteeth\\niron:nutrient needed for red blood cell\\nformation\\nenergy:technically, the ability to perform\\nwork; the content of a substance that \\nallows it to be useful as a fuel\\ntofu: soybean curd, similar in consis-\\ntency to cottage cheese\\nosteoporosis: weakening of the bone\\nstructure\\noxygen: O2, atmospheric gas required\\nby all animals\\nanemia: low level of red blood cells in\\nthe blood\\nfatigue:tiredness\\nlegumes: beans, peas, and related plants'),\n",

All over the world, adoles-\\ncent obesity is on the rise. This has led to an increase in obesity-related dis-\\neases like diabetes and heart disease. Experts believe this rise in obesity is\\ndue to lack of physical activity and an increase in the amount of fast food\\nand “junk food” available to adolescents.

Adolescents tend to be very conscious of appearances\\nand may feel pressure to be thin or to look a certain way. Fear of gaining\\nweight may lead to overly restrictive eating habits. Some teens resort to self-\\ninduced vomiting or laxative use to control their weight. Both boys and girls\\nare affected by eating disorders.

In order to remain healthy,\\nadults must be aware of changes in their energy needs, based on their level\\nof physical activity, and balance their energy intake accordingly.\\nAs teenagers reach adulthood, the basal energy needs for maintaining\\nthe body’s physiological functions (basal metabolic rate , or BMR) stabi-\\nlize, and so energy requirements also stabilize. BMR is defined as the en-\\nergy required by the body to keep functioning. These functions include the\\npumping of blood by the heart, respiration, kidney function, and maintain-\\ning muscle tone and a constant body temperature, among others. BMR is\\ndirectly related to the amount of lean body muscle mass, size, and gender.\\nPhysical activity, especially weight-training exercises, help increase and\\nmaintain lean body mass.\\nIt is very important to reduce one’s energy intake at the onset of adult-\\nhood, and to make sure that all of one’s nutritional needs are met. This can\\nbe accomplished by making sure that an adequate amount of energy is con-\\nsumed (this will vary by body weight, degree of physical fitness, and mus-\\ncle vs. body fat), and that this amount of energy is adjusted to one’s level of\\nphysical activity. Foods that are chosen to provide the energy must be highly\\nnutritious, containing high amounts of essential nutrients such as vitamins,\\nminerals, and essential proteins.\\nIt is usually at this age that young adults start gaining body fat and re-\\nducing their physical activity, resulting in an accumulation of fat in the ab-\\ndominal areas. This is an ever-increasing risk factor in the population of the\\nUnited States, where obesity is not only a problem in adults, but also in\\nchildren. It is believed that the high level of obesity in the United States is\\nmostly due to bad dietary practices such as eating a high-fat, low-complex\\ncarbohydrate(low fiber) diet, including excessive amounts of meat. The\\nindulgence in fast foods and a lack of regular physical activity are major fac-\\ntors. Obesity is a risk factor for other degenerative diseases, such as type II\\n(adult onset) diabetes, diseases of heart and circulation, and certain cancers.\\nAnother nutritional problem related to eating such a diet is constipation,\\ndue to low-fiber diets. This may result in hemorrhoids , diverticulosis ,\\nappendicitis, and other more serious diseases of the lower intestine. In-\\ncreasing the number of servings of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in\\nthe diet will prevent these diseases. In the United States, the Dietary Guide-\\nlines for Americans (as summarized in the Food Guide Pyramid) provide\\npractical guidelines for healthful eating.\\nAt the onset of adulthood, energy requirements usually reach a plateau\\nthat will last until one’s mid-forties, after which they begin to decline, pri-\\nmarily because activity levels and lean muscle mass (amount of muscle vs.\\nbody fat), which represents the BMR, decrease. It is believed that the changes\\nin body composition and reduced lean muscle mass occur at a rate of about\\n5 percent per decade, and energy requirements decrease accordingly. How-\\never, these changes in body composition and decreased energy requirements\\ncan be prevented by maintaining regular physical activity, including resis-\\ntance training, which helps maintain lean muscle mass and prevent deposi-\\ntion of excess body fat.\\n8\\nAdult Nutrition\\nchronic: over a long period\\nosteoporosis: weakening of the bone\\nstructure\\ncardiovascular: related to the heart and\\ncirculatory system\\ncancer: uncontrolled cell growth\\ndiabetes: inability to regulate level of\\nsugar in the blood\\nphysiological: related to the biochemical\\nprocesses of the body\\nbasal metabolic rate: rate of energy\\nconsumption by the body during a period\\nof no activity\\nvitamin: necessary complex nutrient\\nused to aid enzymes or other metabolic\\nprocesses in the cell\\nmineral: an inorganic (non-carbon-\\ncontaining) element, ion, or compound\\nprotein: complex molecule composed of\\namino acids that performs vital functions\\nin the cell; necessary part of the diet\\nobesity: the condition of being over-\\nweight, according to established norms\\nbased on sex, age, and height\\ncarbohydrate: food molecule made of\\ncarbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, including\\nsugars and starches\\nfiber: indigestible plant material that aids\\ndigestion by providing bulk\\ndiet:the total daily food intake, or the\\ntypes of foods eaten\\nconstipation: difficulty passing feces\\nhemorrhoids: swollen blood vessels in\\nthe rectum\\ndiverticulosis:presence of abnormal\\nsmall sacs in the lining of the intestine\\nappendicitis:inflammation of the \\nappendix'),\n",

As a result, some West Indian food traditions\\nare similar to those of African Americans.\\nIt is not surprising that African-American food has a distinctive culinary\\nheritage with diverse flavors, as it includes traditions drawn from the African\\ncontinent, the West Indies, and from North America. While the European\\nnations were busy establishing new societies, they did not realize that the\\nAfrican and West Indian slaves who worked for them brought their own vi-\\nbrant and and rich culture—a culture that would withstand and adapt to the\\nharsh centuries of slavery.\\nFood historian Karen Hess writes about the struggle of African Amer-\\nicans to maintain some of their original culture through food. “The only\\nthing that Africans brought with them [from Africa] was their memories.”\\nSlave traders attempted to craft culturally sensitive rations for the Africans\\nby including yams, rice, corn, plantains, coconuts, and scraps of meat in the\\nslaves’ provisions.\\nSouthern slaves established their own cooking culture using foods that\\nwere similar to foods that were part of their African and West Indian her-\\nitages, and many popular foods in the African-American diet are directly\\nassociated with foods in Africa. For instance, the African yam is similar\\nto the American sweet potato. White rice is also popular because it was\\na major part of the diet in West Africa. African Americans infuse plain\\nrice dishes with their own savory ingredients (popular rice dishes include\\ngumbo and “hoppin’ John,” a dish made with rice, black-eyed peas, and\\nsalt pork or bacon).\\nThe Legacy of African-American Cuisine\\nPopular southern foods, such as the vegetable okra (brought to New Or-\\nleans by African slaves), are often attributed to the importation of goods\\nfrom Africa, or by way of Africa, the West Indies, and the slave trade. Okra,\\nwhich is the principal ingredient in the popular Creole stew referred to as\\ngumbo, is believed to have spiritual and healthful properties. Rice and\\nseafood (along with sausage or chicken), and filé (a sassafras powder inspired\\nby the Choctaw Indians) are also key ingredients in gumbo. Other common\\nfoods that are rooted in African-American culture include black-eyed peas,\\nbenne seeds (sesame), eggplant, sorghum (a grain that produces sweet syrup\\nand different types of flour), watermelon, and peanuts.\\nThough southern food is typically known as “soul food,” many African\\nAmericans contend that soul food consists of African-American recipes that\\nhave been passed down from generation to generation, just like other\\nAfrican-American rituals. The legacy of African and West Indian culture is\\nimbued in many of the recipes and food traditions that remain popular to-\\nday. The staple foods of African Americans, such as rice, have remained\\nlargely unchanged since the first Africans and West Indians set foot in the\\nNew World, and the southern United States, where the slave population\\nwas most dense, has developed a cooking culture that remains true to the\\nAfrican-American tradition.

Over the years, many have interpreted the term soul food\\nbased on current social issues facing the African-American population, such\\nas the civil rights movement. Many civil rights advocates believe that using\\nthis word perpetuates a negative connection between African Americans and\\nslavery. However, as Doris Witt notes in her book Black Hunger (1999), the\\n“soul” of the food refers loosely to the food’s origins in Africa.\\nIn his 1962 essay “Soul Food,” Amiri Baraka makes a clear distinction\\nbetween southern cooking and soul food. To Baraka, soul food includes chit-\\nterlings (pronounced chitlins), pork chops, fried porgies, potlikker, turnips,\\nwatermelon, black-eyed peas, grits, hoppin’ John, hushpuppies, okra, and\\npancakes. Today, many of these foods are limited among African Americans\\nto holidays and special occasions. Southern food, on the other hand, in-\\ncludes only fried chicken, sweet potato pie, collard greens, and barbecue,\\naccording to Baraka. The idea of what soul food is seems to differ greatly\\namong African Americans.\\nGeneral Dietary Influences\\nIn 1992 it was reported that there is little difference between the type of\\nfoods eaten by whites and African Americans. There have, however, been\\nlarge changes in the overall quality of the diet of African Americans since\\nthe 1960s. In 1965, African Americans were more than twice as likely as\\nwhites to eat a diet that met the recommended guidelines for fat, fiber, and\\nfruit and vegetable intakes. By 1996, however, 28 percent of African Amer-\\nicans were reported to have a poor-quality diet, compared to 16 percent of\\nwhites, and 14 percent of other racial groups. The diet of African Ameri-\\ncans is particularly poor for children two to ten years old, for older adults,\\nand for those from a low socioeconomic background. Of all racial groups,\\nAfrican Americans have the most difficulty in eating diets that are low in fat\\nand high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. This represents an immense\\nchange in diet quality. Some explanations for this include: (1) the greater\\nmarket availability of packaged and processed foods; (2) the high cost of\\nfresh fruit, vegetables, and lean cuts of meat; (3) the common practice of\\nfrying food; and (4) using fats in cooking.\\nRegional differences. Although there is little overall variability in diets\\nbetween whites and African Americans, there are many notable regional in-\\nfluences. Many regionally influenced cuisines emerged from the interac-\\ntions of Native American, European, Caribbean, and African cultures. After\\nemancipation, many slaves left the south and spread the influence of soul\\nfood to other parts of the United States. Barbecue is one example of African-\\ninfluenced cuisine that is still widely popular throughout the United States.\\nThe Africans who came to colonial South Carolina from the West Indies\\nbrought with them what is today considered signature southern cookery,\\nknown as barbacoa, or barbecue.

African chefs brought with them specific skills in using various\\nspices, and introduced okra and native American foodstuffs, such as craw-\\nfish, shrimp, oysters, crabs, and pecans, into both Cajun and Creole cui-\\nsine. Originally, Cajun meals were bland, and nearly all foods were boiled.\\nRice was used in Cajun dishes to stretch out meals to feed large families.\\nToday, Cajun cooking tends to be spicier and more robust than Creole.\\nSome popular Cajun dishes include pork-based sausages, jambalayas, gum-\\nbos, and coush-coush (a creamed corn dish). The symbol of Cajun cook-\\ning is, perhaps, the crawfish, but until the 1960s crawfish were used mainly\\nas bait.\\nMore recently, the immigration of people from the Caribbean and South\\nAmerica has influenced African-American cuisine in the south. New spices,\\ningredients, combinations, and cooking methods have produced popular\\ndishes such as Jamaican jerk chicken, fried plantains, and bean dishes such\\nas Puerto Rican habichuelas and Brazilian feijoada.\\nHolidays and Traditions. African-American meals are deeply rooted in\\ntraditions, holidays, and celebrations. For American slaves, after long hours\\nworking in the fields the evening meal was a time for families to gather, re-\\nflect, tell stories, and visit with loved ones and friends. Today, the Sunday\\nmeal after church continues to serve as a prime gathering time for friends\\nand family.\\nKwanzaa, which means “first fruits of the harvest,” is a holiday observed\\nby more than 18 million people worldwide. Kwanzaa is an African-American\\ncelebration that focuses on the traditional African values of family, commu-\\nnity responsibility, commerce, and self-improvement. The Kwanzaa Feast, or\\nKaramu, is traditionally held on December 31. This symbolizes the celebra-\\ntion that brings the community together to exchange and to give thanks for\\ntheir accomplishments during the year. A typical menu includes a black-eyed\\npea dish, greens, sweet potato pudding, cornbread, fruit cobbler or compote\\ndessert, and many other special family dishes.\\nFolk beliefs and remedies. Folk beliefs and remedies have also been\\npassed down through generations, and they can still be observed today. The\\nmajority of African-American beliefs surrounding food concern the medic-\\ninal uses of various foods. For example, yellow root tea is believed to cure\\nillness and lower blood sugar. The bitter yellow root contains the antihist-\\namine berberine and may cause mild low blood pressure. One of the most\\npopular folk beliefs is that excess blood will travel to the head when one eats\\nlarge amounts of pork, thereby causing hypertension. However, it is not\\nthe fresh pork that should be blamed for this rise in blood pressure, but the\\nsalt-cured pork products that are commonly eaten. Today, folk beliefs and\\nremedies are most often held in high regard and practiced by the elder and\\nmore traditional members of the population.\\nEffects of Socioeconomic Status: Poverty and Health\\nMany of the foods commonly eaten by African Americans, such as greens,\\nyellow vegetables, legumes, beans, and rice, are rich in nutrients. Because\\nof cooking methods and the consumption of meats and baked goods, how-\\never, the diet is also typically high in fat and low in fiber, calcium, and\\n13\\nAfrican Americans, Diet of\\nblood pressure: measure of the pres-\\nsure exerted by the blood against the\\nwalls of the blood vessels\\nhypertension: high blood pressure\\nlegumes: beans, peas, and related plants\\nnutrient: dietary substance necessary\\nfor health\\ncalcium:mineral essential for bones and\\nteeth'),\n",

In 1989, 9.3 million of the black population (30.1%) had incomes\\nbelow the poverty level.

In the United States, the prevalence of high\\nblood pressure in African Americans is among the highest in the world.\\nThe alarming rates of increase of obesity and high blood pressure, along\\nwith the deaths from diabetes-related complications, heart disease, and\\nkidney failure, have spurred government agencies to take a harder look\\nat these problems. As a result, many U.S. agencies have created national\\ninitiatives to improve the diet quality and the overall health of African\\nAmericans.\\nLooking Forward to a Healthier Tomorrow\\nAfrican-American food and its dietary evolvement since the beginning of\\nAmerican slavery provide a complicated, yet extremely descriptive, picture\\nof the effects of politics, society, and the economy on culture. The deep-\\nrooted dietary habits and economic issues that continue to affect African\\nAmericans present great challenges regarding changing behaviors and low-\\nering disease risk. In January 2000, the U.S. Department of Health and\\nHuman Services launched Healthy People 2010, a comprehensive, nation-\\nwide health promotion and disease prevention agenda. The overarching goal\\nof this program is to increase quality and years of healthy life and eliminate\\nhealth disparities between whites and minority populations, specifically\\nAfrican Americans. As national health initiatives and programs continue to\\nimprove and target African Americans and other populations in need, pre-\\nventable diseases will be lowered, creating a healthier U.S. society.

Africa’s history\\nincludes some of humankind’s earliest food production, with one of the most\\nfertile centers located in Northern Africa, the Nile Valley. The Nile Valley\\nhistorically was and continues to be a rich source of fish, animal, and plant\\nfood. In the drier African savannas, especially after the Sahara region be-\\ncame arid after 6000 B.C.E., nomad tribes raised cattle, goats, or sheep, which\\nserved as part of the tribes’ food source. Crops that were less affected by\\nextreme weather like cereals (such as wheat, barley, millet, and sorghum)\\nand tubers (such as yams) slowly became popular throughout the continent\\nand have remained important staples in the African diet today.\\nThe African Climate and Terrain. The historic influences on the\\nAfrican diet began in ancient times and continue to the present day. Great\\ngeographic differences across the African continent caused much of the va-\\nriety in the African diet. In addition, many tribes and peoples migrated or\\ntraded, bringing spices and foods from each other’s culture into their own.\\nHowever, though each region of Africa has its distinct cuisines, African food\\nhas its basic staples.\\nThe African Diet\\nThroughout Africa, the main meal of the day is lunch, which usually con-\\nsists of a mixture of vegetables, legumes, and sometimes meat. However,\\nthough different meats are considered staples in many areas, many Africans\\nare not able to eat meat often, due to economic constraints. Beef, goat, and\\nsheep (mutton) are quite expensive in Africa, so these foods are reserved for\\nspecial days. However, fish is abundant in coastal regions and in many lakes.\\nThe combination of various foods is called stew, soup, or sauce, de-\\npending on the region. This mixture is then served over a porridge or mash\\nmade from a root vegetable such as cassava or a grain such as rice, corn,\\nmillet, or teff. Regional differences are reflected in variations on this basic\\nmeal, primarily in the contents of the stew. The greatest variety of ingre-\\ndients occurs in coastal areas and in the fertile highlands. Flavorings and\\nspiciness have varied principally due to local histories of trade. In the tra-\\nditional African diet, meat and fish are not the focus of a meal, but are in-\\nstead used to enhance the stew that accompanies the mash or porridge. Meat\\nis rarely eaten, though it is well-liked among carnivorous (meat-eating)\\nAfricans.\\nTraditional Cooking Methods. Traditional ways of cooking involve\\nsteaming food in leaf wrappers (banana or corn husks), boiling, frying in oil,\\ngrilling beside a fire, roasting in a fire, or baking in ashes. Africans normally\\ncook outdoors or in a building separate from the living quarters. African\\nkitchens commonly have a stew pot sitting on three stones arranged around\\na fire. In Africa, meals are normally eaten with the hands.\\nNorth Africa\\nThe countries of North Africa that border the Mediterranean Sea are largely\\nMuslim countries. As a result, their diet reflects Islamic traditions.

Like other\\nregions of Africa, much of the diet is based on grains. However, cooking\\nwith olive oil, onions, and garlic is more common in the countries of North\\nAfrica. Notable spices include cumin, caraway, clove, and cinnamon. Flat\\nbreads are a common staple and can accompany any meal, including break-\\nfast, which is usually porridge prepared from millet or chickpea flour. Cous-\\ncous (made from hard wheat and millet) is often the main dish at lunch, which\\nis the primary meal. This may be accompanied by vegetable salads. Other\\nmain dishes include tajine,named for the conical clay pot in which a whole\\nmeal is prepared. Lamb is cooked in tajines as well as on kabobs (roasted\\non a skewer). Vegetables include okra, meloukhia (spinach-like greens), and\\nradishes. Common fruits are oranges, lemons, pears, and mandrakes.\\nLegumes such as broad beans (fava beans), lentils, yellow peas, and black-\\neyed peas are also important staples. Alcoholic drinks are forbidden by Is-\\nlamic tradition. Mint tea and coffee are very popular beverages in this\\nregion.\\nWest Africa\\nWithin West Africa, there is considerable variation in the staple food. Rice\\nis predominant from Mauritania to Liberia and across to the Sahel, a region\\nthat stretches across the continent between the Sahara and the southern sa-\\nvannas. Couscous is the prevalent dish in the Sahara. Along the coast from\\nCôte d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) to Nigeria and Cameroon, root crops, primar-\\nily varieties of yam and cassava, are common.

Giant snails are also eaten in various parts of West Africa.\\nEast Africa\\nExtensive trade and migrations with Arabic countries and South Asia has\\nmade East African culture unique, particularly on the coast. The main sta-\\nples include potatoes, rice, matake (mashed plantains), and a maize meal that\\nis cooked up into a thick porridge. Beans or a stew with meat, potatoes, or\\nvegetables often accompany the porridge. Beef, goat, chicken, or sheep are\\nthe most common meats. Outside of Kenya and the horn of Africa, the stew\\nis not as spicy, but the coastal area has spicy, coconut-based stews. This is\\nquite unique in comparison to the central and southern parts of Africa.\\nTwo herding tribes, the Maasai and Fulbe, have a notably different eat-\\ning pattern. They do not eat very much meat, except for special occasions.\\nInstead, they subsist on fresh and soured milk and butter as their staples.\\nThis is unusual because very few Africans consume milk or dairy products,\\nprimarily due to lactose intolerance.\\nThe horn of Africa, which includes modern-day Somalia and Ethiopia,\\nis characterized by its remarkably spicy food prepared with chilies and gar-\\nlic.

Fruits and vegetables\\nin southern Africa include bananas, pineapples, pau-pau (papaya), mangoes,\\navocadoes, tomatoes, carrots, onions, potatoes, and cabbage. Nonetheless,\\nthe traditional meal in southern Africa is centered on a staple crop, usually\\nrice or maize, served with a stew. The most common dish made from corn-\\nmeal is called mealie meal, or pap in South Africa. Also known as nshima or\\nnsima further north, it is usually eaten with stew poured over it.

The result is an unbalanced diet. In many parts of Africa, the\\ntraditional diets of indigenous peoples are often inadequate in essential\\nvitamins, minerals, and protein, which can lead to a variety of diseases.\\nMicronutrient deficiencies, particularly vitamin A, iodine, and iron defi-\\nciencies, which can result in vision impairment, goiter, and anemia, re-\\nspectively, are prevalent throughout much of Africa, particularly in the arid\\nareas where the soil is deficient either naturally or due to overuse.\\nFood Security\\nA far greater threat comes from increasingly insecure food sources (a lack\\nof consistent and affordable food staples) arising from adverse weather\\n(drought and floods) and war. During the late 1900s, famine became in-\\ncreasingly frequent in Africa. In addition, a new threat to the food supply\\nemerged due to the worsening HIV/AIDS epidemic.

The baby boomers,\\nthose born between 1946 and 1964, will first reach age 65 in 2011, trans-\\nforming the 35 million people over age 65 in 2000 to an estimated 69 mil-\\nlion by 2030. With improved health care, socioeconomic status, and health\\nbehaviors, people 85 and over are expected to be the fastest-growing group\\nof elderly persons, tripling from 4 million in 2000 to about 14 million by\\n2040. Growth in the elderly population has led to two subgroups: the young-\\nold (55 to 74 years) and the old-old (75 and older). Still, elderly people re-\\nmain the most diverse segment of American society.\\nA nutritious daily diet is one factor that can assist people who are 55\\nand older in maintaining optimal levels of health and preventing or delay-\\ning the onset of disease. The Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) are the\\nquantities of nutrients that form the basis for planning and assessing diets.\\nThe DRIs include the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), the\\nnutrient levels that meet the requirement for nearly all (97–98%) healthy\\npeople. Two sets of RDAs exist for elderly individuals, one for those 51 to\\n70 years of age, and one for those over 70 years of age.\\nAccording to the RDAs, elderly people have the same nutrient require-\\nments as their younger counterparts, yet most need fewer calories. Vita-\\nmins D and B 6, and calcium, are exceptions and are needed in greater\\namounts for those 51 years old and older. Therefore, a nutrient-dense diet,\\nwith fewer calorie-laden foods, becomes more crucial at older ages of the\\nlife cycle. In general, women have nutrient requirements similar to men,\\nthough they require fewer calories. Therefore, elderly women must be es-\\npecially careful to select nutrient-dense foods.\\nThe best way to establish a nutrient-dense diet is to balance a variety\\nof food choices (in moderation) that are adequate to meet nutritional and\\ncaloric needs. The Food Guide Pyramid (FGP) is helpful to guide food se-\\nlection and daily serving totals. An FGP specifically for those over 70 years\\nof age recommends 1,200–1,600 calories from whole-grain foods, a variety\\nof colored fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, lean meats, fish and\\npoultry, and eight glasses of fluid daily. Food labels help put single servings\\nof food into the FGP. Results of national dietary surveys have led some ex-\\nperts to recommend calcium supplements and a one-a-day type of multiple\\nvitamin. Other health food supplements are not generally needed and can\\nbe very expensive for those on fixed incomes.\\nNutrition Screening Initiative\\nElderly individuals are at increased risk for problems that affect their nutri-\\ntional status. The nationwide Nutrition Screening Initiative (NSI) catego-\\nrizes these problems as those affecting functional, social, or financial status and\\naccess to food and drink.

Alcohol provides no vitamins or miner-\\nals, only calories. Small amounts of alcohol are absorbed from the mouth,\\napproximately 20 percent is absorbed in the stomach, and the remaining 80\\npercent is absorbed in the small intestine.\\nAbout 7 percent of Americans abuse alcohol or suffer from alcoholism.\\nAlcoholism can be identified through four symptoms: (1) a craving or strong\\nurge to drink alcohol, (2) not being able to stop drinking, (3) physical depen-\\ndence, and (4) tolerance. Physical dependence occurs when an individual de-\\npends on the presence of alcohol to function normally. Tolerance occurs when\\nthe same amount of alcohol results in a lesser effect; therefore, more alcohol\\nmust be consumed in order to feel the same effect. Alcohol abuse differs from\\nalcoholism in that it does not include a strong craving for alcohol, the loss of\\ncontrol over one’s drinking, or physical dependence. Individuals may have a\\nproblem with alcohol abuse if they exhibit one or more of the following symp-\\ntoms: work and money problems, drinking while driving, being arrested due\\nto drinking, exhibiting violent or aggressive behaviors, or continuing to drink\\ndespite the problems that result from drinking.\\nAlcoholism\\nAlthough there is a debate among experts over whether alcoholism should\\nbe considered a disease, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alco-\\nholism recognizes alcoholism as a disease. The risk for developing alco-\\nholism is influenced by a person’s genes and lifestyle behaviors. Alcoholism\\nis a chronic disease that lasts for a lifetime. If diagnosed and treated early,\\nhowever, alcoholism may be completely cured and severe complications\\nprevented. Chronic alcohol abuse increases a person’s risk for developing\\nserious health problems, such as liver disease, high blood pressure, heart\\ndisease, stroke, cancer (especially cancer of the esophagus, mouth, and\\nthroat), and pancreatitis.\\nApproximately two million Americans suffer from liver damage caused\\nby alcohol abuse. About 10 to 20 percent of heavy drinkers will develop cir-\\nrhosis of the liver, which is characterized by scarring of the liver and causes\\nirreversible damage. If heavy drinkers do not stop drinking, cirrhosis can\\ncause poor health and, ultimately, death. In addition to cirrhosis, heavy\\ndrinkers may suffer from chronic liver disease or alcoholic hepatitis.\\nDamage to the liver can lead to problems with blood sugar levels. When\\nalcohol is present in the body, the liver works to metabolize it. Because the\\nliver is busy metabolizing alcohol, it is often not able to adequately main-\\ntain blood sugar levels, which may result in hypoglycemia (low levels of\\nblood sugar). Hypoglycemia is most likely to occur in individuals who have\\nnot maintained an adequate diet. When it occurs, the brain is not able to\\nreceive the energy it needs to function, and symptoms such as hunger, weak-\\nness, headache, tremor, and even coma (in severe cases) may occur.\\nChronic alcohol abuse can lead to poor nutritional status. Chronic heavy\\ndrinkers do not eat adequate amounts of food because of the high caloric\\ncontent of alcohol. This prevents them from getting the required vitamins\\nand minerals to maintain health and well-being. Furthermore, when a per-\\nson consumes large amounts of alcohol, it impedes or halts the digestion of\\nfood, as alcohol decreases the secretion of digestive enzymes from the pan-\\n24\\nAlcohol and Health\\nvitamin: necessary complex nutrient\\nused to aid enzymes or other metabolic\\nprocesses in the cell\\nmineral: an inorganic (non-carbon-\\ncontaining) element, ion, or compound\\ncalorie:unit of food energy\\ndependence: a condition in which at-\\ntempts to stop use leads to withdrawal\\nsymptoms, including irritability and in-\\nsomnia\\ntolerance: development of a need for in-\\ncreased amount of drug to obtain a given\\nlevel of intoxication\\ngene: DNA sequence that codes for pro-\\nteins, and thus controls inheritance\\nlifestyle: set of choices about diet, exer-\\ncise, job type, leisure activities, and other\\naspects of life\\nchronic: over a long period\\nhigh blood pressure: elevation of the\\npressure in the bloodstream maintained\\nby the heart\\nheart disease: any disorder of the heart\\nor its blood supply, including heart at-\\ntack, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery\\ndisease\\nstroke: loss of blood supply to part of\\nthe brain, due to a blocked or burst\\nartery in the brain\\ncancer: uncontrolled cell growth\\nhepatitis: liver inflammation\\nmetabolize: processing of a nutrient\\nhypoglycemia: low blood sugar level\\ndiet: the total daily food intake, or the\\ntypes of foods eaten\\nenergy:technically, the ability to perform\\nwork; the content of a substance that al-\\nlows it to be useful as a fuel\\nenzyme: protein responsible for carrying\\nout reactions in a cell'),\n",

Alcohol also inhibits the absorption of nutrients into the blood. This\\ndecrease in digestion and absorption over a long period of time can lead to\\nmalnutrition.\\nHigh-Risk Groups\\nWhile alcohol abuse and alcoholism affect virtually every segment of the\\npopulation, certain groups are at greater risk. Young adults between the ages\\nof eighteen and twenty-nine have the highest prevalence of alcohol abuse,\\nand persons who begin to drink at an early age, especially before the age of\\nfourteen, have a greater risk for developing problems with alcohol. Persons\\nwith a family history of alcohol abuse or alcoholism are also more likely to\\nexperience alcohol-related problems. In the United States, American Indi-\\nans and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) have the highest rates of current and heavy\\ndrinking of all racial or ethnic groups. Deaths from chronic liver disease and\\ncirrhosis are nearly four times greater among AI/ANs compared to the gen-\\neral U.S. population. They also have a higher prevalence of drunk driving\\ncompared to the general U.S. population.\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. De-\\npartment of Agriculture recommend that alcohol be consumed in modera-\\ntion only. Moderation is considered two drinks per day for men and one\\ndrink per day for women (one drink is defined as twelve ounces of beer, five\\nounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of a distilled spirit). Drinking alcohol is in-\\nappropriate for recovering alcoholics, persons under the age of twenty-one,\\npersons taking medication, those who plan to drive, and women who are\\npregnant or plan to become pregnant.\\nThere is no known safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy,\\nas it could injure the fetus.

Worldwide, ad-\\nverse reactions to food constitute a significant public health issue.\\nDefinitions\\nThe term adverse reaction is used to describe health problems linked to food.\\nFood allergy and food intolerance are two types of adverse food reactions\\n(food-borne illnesses caused by bacterial, viral, or other forms of contamina-\\ntion are also adverse reactions). A food allergy is said to exist when the health\\nproblem is linked to a malfunction of the immune system. It is believed\\nthat this malfunctioning occurs when the body identifies a food protein\\n(allergen) as a harmful substance. Food intolerance occurs when the under-\\nlying problem causing the adverse reaction is not related to a malfunction\\nof the immune system. One example of a food intolerance is lactose intol-\\nerance, a condition affecting people who cannot digest milk due to a defi-\\nciency of the enzyme lactase, which breaks down milk sugar (lactose).\\n26\\nAllergies and Intolerances\\nallergy: immune system reaction against\\nsubstances that are otherwise harmless\\nimmune system: the set of organs and\\ncells, including white blood cells, that\\nprotect the body from infection\\nprotein: complex molecule composed of\\namino acids that performs vital functions\\nin the cell; necessary part of the diet\\nallergen: a substance that provokes an\\nallergic reaction\\nlactose intolerance: inability to digest\\nlactose, or milk sugar\\nenzyme:protein responsible for carrying\\nout reactions in a cell'),\n",

For example, an allergy to rice is common in Southeast Asia, while\\nfish allergy is a problem in the Scandinavian countries, where fish is fre-\\nquently consumed (even at breakfast). Age is also a factor influencing the\\ntypes of foods to which a person might be allergic. In the United States,\\ncommon foods to which adults are allergic include eggs, shrimp, lobster,\\npeanuts, other nuts, and fish. U.S. children who have food allergies find\\ntheir problems are most frequently linked to milk, soy, eggs, and peanuts.\\nInfants may be allergic to cow’s milk or soy formulas. Some food allergies\\nmay be outgrown, but allergies to peanuts, shrimp, and fish tend to last\\nthroughout life. In addition, some individuals are only allergic to one food,\\nwhereas some are allergic to several foods.\\nAn allergic reaction can be triggered by a very small amount of a food.\\nPersons with food allergies need to read food labels carefully and ask\\nrestaurant workers about food ingredients, and the food industry needs\\nto ensure that processed foods are appropriately prepared so that peo-\\nple are not exposed to food allergens unknowingly. This may happen when\\nimproperly cleaned food equipment is used to prepare multiple types of\\nfood.\\nFood Allergy: Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis\\nHealth problems associated with food allergies can involve the gastroin-\\ntestinal system, the respiratory system, the skin, and the eyes. Persons\\nwith a food allergy may have difficulty breathing, or they may have prob-\\nlems with itching, rashes, swelling, nausea, or vomiting. A food allergy may\\nalso be a cause of asthma.\\n27\\nAllergies and Intolerances\\nFood allergies can be triggered by\\nalmost any food.

Food\\nallergies can also cause a severe clinical reaction known as anaphylaxis,\\nwhich can result in death. Anaphylaxis may be characterized by throat and\\nlip swelling, shortness of breath, sweating, itching, and feeling very faint.\\nDiagnosis of a food allergy usually involves a careful examination of the\\npatient’s symptom history. Other causes of symptoms must be ruled out,\\nand in some instances the suspected food or foods will be eliminated from\\nthe diet to see if symptoms stop. Blood tests or skin tests may also be per-\\nformed. One test sometimes used to diagnose food allergy is the double-\\nblind, placebo-controlled food challenge. This test involves giving a patient\\na capsule containing a suspected food allergen and a capsule without the al-\\nlergen (the placebo) and seeing if either causes symptoms in a controlled\\nclinical setting. The test is called double-blind because neither the patient nor\\nthe physician evaluating the symptoms is aware of which capsule contains\\nthe allergen at the time the testing occurs.\\nCommon Foods Associated with Intolerance\\nFoods associated with intolerance include: preserved foods, foods contain-\\ning monosodium glutamate (MSG, a flavor enhancer), and specific foods\\nsuch as milk, pickled herring, soy sauce, chili peppers, and nutmeg. Intol-\\nerance to lactose is a major problem for many populations. In the United\\nStates, lactose intolerance is common among those of African and Asian de-\\nscent. The Native American population also has a high prevalence of lac-\\ntose intolerance.\\nFor many food intolerances, including those listed above, specific chem-\\nicals or enzyme abnormalities have been identified as being associated with\\nthe intolerance. Lactose intolerance is associated with problems with the en-\\nzyme lactase. Chemicals associated with food intolerance include sulfite (in\\npreserved foods), tyramine (in pickled herring and soy sauce), capsaicin (in\\nchili peppers), and myristicin (in nutmeg).\\nFood Intolerance: Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis\\nHealth problems caused by food intolerance vary depending upon the food\\nand chemical involved. The amount of a food eaten may also play a role.\\nLactose intolerance is usually characterized by gastrointestinal problems such\\nas bloating and diarrhea. Sulfite intolerance is typically characterized by dif-\\nficulty in breathing. Those sensitive to MSG may experience a variety of\\nsymptoms, such as headache, numbness, and rapid heartbeat. Tyramine,\\nfound in pickled herring, soy sauce, red wine, and other foods, has been linked\\nto migraine headache. Capsaicin can cause a “burning” pain in the mouth\\nand other problems, such as nausea and vomiting. Myristicin has been asso-\\nciated with anxiety, chest pressure, hallucinations, fever, and skin redness.\\nDiagnostic techniques for food intolerances vary depending upon the\\nspecific intolerance suspected. Symptom history and elimination diets are\\ntools that are used, and the double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge\\nmay also be helpful. Diagnosis of lactose intolerance in adults may involve\\nmeasuring the blood to see if lactose is being broken down and showing up\\nas blood sugar (glucose), or by measuring the level of hydrogen in the\\nbreath, which is increased in persons who are lactose intolerant (lactose pro-\\nduces hydrogen gas in the colon).\\n28\\nAllergies and Intolerances\\nanaphylaxis: life-threatening allergic re-\\naction, involving drop in blood pressure\\nand swelling of soft tissues especially\\nsurrounding the airways\\ndiet: the total daily food intake, or the\\ntypes of foods eaten\\nprevalence:describing the number of\\ncases in a population at any one time\\nAntihistamines can give some relief of\\nminor allergic reactions, such as skin\\nirritation.

The connection of these problems to food allergies\\nis not universally recognized. Some have also linked hyperactivity to food\\nallergy or intolerance. Hyperactivity in children, in some instances, may be\\nrelated to eating large amounts of food additives, but it is not accepted to\\nbe an allergic condition by the majority of the scientific community.\\nOther controversies relate to testing for food allergies. One controver-\\nsial test is cytotoxic testing, which involves testing blood in the presence of\\nthe suspected food allergen to see if the blood cells are killed.\\nTreatment of Food Allergies and Intolerances\\nThe major mode of treatment for food allergies and intolerances is for the\\nperson to avoid consuming the food or foods that seem to cause health prob-\\nlems. This involves a high degree of dietary awareness and careful food se-\\nlection. When foods are eliminated from the diet, it is important to ensure\\nthe nutritional adequacy of the diet, and some individuals may need to take\\ndietary supplements. There are some food intolerances, such as lactose in-\\ntolerance, where individuals may be able to reduce the amount of the food\\nconsumed and not totally eliminate it from the diet.

The\\nincidence of peanut allergies among children\\ndoubled in the United States between 1997\\nand 2002, prompting some schools to consider\\nbanning peanuts and peanut products from\\ntheir premises.

Oth-\\ners argue that a peanut ban provides a false\\nsense of security for children who inhabit a\\npeanut-ridden world, and that educating stu-\\ndents and school personnel about the prob-\\nlem, and preparing for the occasional incident,\\nare more appropriate responses.\\n—Paula Kepos\\nbrain allergy: allergy whose symptoms\\naffect brain function\\nenvironmental illness: illness due to\\nsubstances in the environment\\nyeast allergy:allergy to yeasts used in\\nbaking or brewing\\nfood additive:substance added to foods\\nto improve nutrition, taste, appearance,\\nor shelf-life'),\n",

Alternative therapies appear to be used most fre-\\nquently for medical conditions that are chronic, such as back pain, arthri-\\ntis, sleep disorders, headache, and digestive problems. Surveys of U.S.\\nconsumers have shown that more people visit alternative practitioners each\\nyear than visit conventional primary-care physicians. Consumers do not nec-\\nessarily reject conventional medicine, however. Many simply feel that al-\\nternative modalities offer complementary approaches that are more in line\\nwith their personal health philosophies.\\nAlternative Medicine, Complementary Medicine, \\nand Integrative Medicine\\nThe terms alternative medicine and alternative therapies refer to those med-\\nical practices that are not considered to be conventional medicine, as prac-\\nticed in the United States. Other cultures, however, may use one or more\\nof these approaches regularly, and, in fact, many have done so for thousands\\nof years. Most people in the United States who use alternative medicine do\\nso to complement conventional approaches. For example, in addition to us-\\ning anti-inflammatory drugs to ease muscle pain, they may also use mas-\\nsage, chiropractic, and/or osteopathic manipulation. This practice of\\ncomplementing conventional medicine with alternative approaches has given\\nrise to the term complementary medicine. Presently, alternative medicine is\\nmost commonly referred to as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).\\nAs conventional medical practitioners become familiar with alternative ap-\\nproaches, these approaches are being integrated into conventional medicine,\\nwhich is giving rise to integrative medicine, in which a combination of ther-\\napies representing the best of conventional and alternative medicine is used.\\nTypes of CAM Modalities\\nThe National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine di-\\nvides the various CAM modalities into five categories: (1) alternative med-\\nical systems, (2) mind-body interventions, (3) biologically-based treatments,\\n(4) manipulative and body-based methods, and (5) energy therapies. These\\nmodalities include a wide variety of approaches, from acupuncture to nutri-\\ntion to meditation to chiropractic.\\nAlternative medical systems include medical practices that are traditional\\nin other cultures, such as the ayurvedic medical system of India, Chinese tra-\\nditional medicine, and traditional Native American and Hawaiian medicine.\\n30\\nAlternative Medicines and Therapies\\nchronic: over a long period\\narthritis: inflammation of the joints\\ndrugs: substances whose administration\\ncauses a significant change in the body’s\\nfunction\\nchiropractic: manipulation of the spine\\nand other bones for healing\\nosteopathic:related to the practice of\\nosteopathy, which combines standard\\nmedical therapy with manipulation of the\\nskeleton to correct problems\\nenergy: technically, the ability to perform\\nwork; the content of a substance that \\nallows it to be useful as a fuel\\nacupuncture: insertion of needles into\\nthe skin at special points to treat disease\\nnutrition:the maintenance of health\\nthrough proper eating, or the study of\\nsame\\nmeditation: stillness of thought, prac-\\nticed to reduce tension and increase in-\\nner peace\\nayurvedic: an Indian healing system'),\n",

Biologically-based modalities are primarily nutrition-\\nrelated and vary from special diets such as the macrobiotic diet to the in-\\nclusion of dietary supplements in the diet. Body-based methods involve\\nhands-on manipulation of the body, and include such modalities as massage\\nand chiropractic. The energy therapies are based on the concept that the\\nbody has an energy field that can be manipulated to promote healing.\\nIncluded among the nutrition approaches that make up the biologically-\\nbased modalities is the use of dietary supplements.

The passage of DSHEA provided consumers with\\nthe right to purchase dietary supplements that they felt would help them\\nattain their personal health goals. At the same time, DSHEA transferred\\nto consumers the responsibility for making informed choices about the\\nsupplements that they used. In contrast to prescription and over-the-\\ncounter drugs, where effectiveness and safety must be demonstrated prior\\nto marketing of the drugs, premarket approval is not required of manu-\\nfacturers of dietary supplements.

Instead of the drug manufacturer and the physician working to\\ninsure that a drug meets the needs of the patient and that it is both safe and\\neffective, consumers must provide these services for themselves with dietary\\nsupplements.

Claims that a dietary supplement may help to prevent or\\ncure a disease cannot be made. Such claims are considered health claims\\nand must be reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration for scien-\\ntific accuracy prior to approval for use on a product label. Manufactur-\\ners may, however, use structure/function claims that state that a product\\ncan, for example, “help to promote healthy blood levels of cholesterol ,”\\nbut they may not state that a product “helps to prevent heart disease .”\\nAll structure/function claims must be accompanied by the following dis-\\nclaimer: “This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug\\nAdministration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or\\nprevent any disease.”\\nSelecting a CAM Modality\\nWhen selecting a CAM modality, it is important to have clearly defined\\nhealth goals. In other words, what are you trying to accomplish, and is this\\nmodality an appropriate fit for you? If selecting a therapy, determine if the\\npractitioner of the therapy being considered is a licensed health care prac-\\ntitioner. Licensure does not guarantee the modality will successfully meet\\none’s needs, but it does provide some assurance of training and competency\\non the part of the practitioner. This information can usually be obtained\\nfrom the various state boards of medicine, which are responsible for licens-\\ning health care professionals.\\nSelecting quality dietary supplements can be a bit more challenging.\\nBoth the natural products industry and the Food and Drug Administration\\nare working to develop uniform standards of quality for dietary supplements.\\nUntil these standards are in place, however, consumers must be proactive\\nin determining for themselves what supplements are consistent with their\\nhealth goals and what manufacturers offer quality products. It is important\\nnot to be fooled by hype. Be wary of supplements that sound too good to\\nbe true or that promise to cure a medical condition.\\nQuality natural ingredients and responsible product testing can add sig-\\nnificantly to the cost of a dietary supplement. The cheapest supplement is\\nnot always the best buy, though a high price does not necessarily guarantee\\nhigh quality. It is important to investigate the supplement manufacturer\\nwhose products are being considered. Manufacturer contact information ap-\\npears on the supplement facts label. One should inquire whether the man-\\nufacturer uses Good Manufacturing Practices, how they ensure the purity\\nof their ingredients, and whether they have their products tested by inde-\\npendent laboratories to verify that the label accurately reflects the product\\nin the supplement container.\\nAlternative therapies are increasingly being used to complement con-\\nventional medicine. The consumer should be knowledgeable of the modal-\\nity chosen, its intended purpose, and whether it is appropriate for that\\npurpose.

The body has twenty dif-\\nferent amino acids that act as these building blocks. Nonessential amino\\nacids are those that the body can synthesize for itself, provided there is\\nenough nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen available. Essential amino\\nacids are those supplied by the diet, since the human body either cannot\\nmake them at all or cannot make them in sufficient quantity to meet its\\nneeds. Under normal conditions, eleven of the amino acids are nonessen-\\ntial and nine are essential.\\nStructure\\nAll amino acids have a similar chemical structure—each contains an amino\\ngroup (NH2), an acid group (COOH), a hydrogen atom (H), and a distinctive\\nside group that makes proteins more complex than either carbohydrates or\\nlipids. All amino acids are attached to a central carbon atom (C).\\nThe distinctive side group identifies each amino acid and gives it char-\\nacteristics that attract it to, or repel it from, the surrounding fluids and other\\namino acids. Some amino acid side groups carry electrical charges that are\\nattracted to water molecules (hydrophilic), while others are neutral and are\\nrepelled by water (hydrophobic).

Each amino acid is linked to the next by a pep-\\ntide bond, the name given to the link or attraction between the acid (COOH)\\nend of one amino acid and the amino end (NH2) of another. Proteins of\\nvarious lengths are made when amino acids are linked together in this man-\\nner. A dipeptide is two amino acids joined by a peptide bond, while a tripep-\\ntide is three amino acids joined by peptide bonds.\\nThe unique shapes of proteins enable them to perform their various\\ntasks in the body. Heat, acid, or other conditions can disturb proteins, caus-\\ning them to uncoil or lose their shape and impairing their ability to func-\\ntion. This is referred to as denaturation.\\nFunctions of Proteins\\nProteins act as enzymes, hormones, and antibodies. They maintain fluid\\nbalance and acid and base balance. They also transport substances such as\\noxygen, vitamins, and minerals to target cells throughout the body. Struc-\\ntural proteins, such as collagen and keratin, are responsible for the forma-\\ntion of bones, teeth, hair, and the outer layer of skin, and they help maintain\\nthe structure of blood vessels and other tissues. In contrast, motor proteins\\nuse energy and convert it into some form of mechanical work (e.g., divid-\\ning cells, contracting muscle).\\nEnzymes are proteins that facilitate chemical reactions without being\\nchanged in the process. The inactive form of an enzyme is called a proen-\\nzyme. Hormones (chemical messengers) are proteins that travel to one or\\nmore specific target tissues or organs, and many have important regulatory\\nfunctions. Insulin, for example, plays a key role in regulating the amount\\nof glucose in the blood. The body manufactures antibodies (giant protein\\nmolecules), which combat invading antigens. Antigens are usually foreign\\nsubstances such as bacteria and viruses that have entered the body and\\ncould potentially be harmful. Immunoproteins, also called immunoglobu-\\nlins or antibodies, defend the body from possible attack by these invaders\\nby binding to the antigens and inactivating them.\\nProteins help to maintain the body’s fluid and electrolyte balance. This\\nmeans that proteins ensure that the proper types and amounts of fluid and\\nminerals are present in each of the body’s three fluid compartments. These\\nfluid compartments are intracellular (contained within cells), extracellular (ex-\\nisting outside the cell), and intravascular (in the blood). Without this bal-\\nance, the body cannot function properly.\\nProteins also help to maintain balance between acids and bases within\\nbody fluids. The lower a fluid’s pH, the more acidic it is. Conversely, the\\nhigher the pH, the less acidic the fluid is. The body works hard to keep the\\npH of the blood near 7.4 (neutral). Proteins also act as carriers, transport-\\ning many important substances in the bloodstream for delivery throughout\\nthe body. For example, a lipoprotein transports fat and cholesterol in the\\nblood.\\nFood Sources\\nHumans consume many foods that contain proteins or amino acids.

It has a signifi-\\ncant prevalence in both developing and industrialized nations. Causes of\\nanemia include nutritional deficiencies , particularly of iron, vitamin B12,\\nand folate (folic acid); excess blood loss from menstruation or chronic\\nillness and infection; ingestion of toxic substances, such as lead, ethanol,\\nand other compounds; and genetic abnormalities such as thalassemia\\nand sideroblastosis .\\nAnemia is caused by a deficiency in the intake and absorption elements\\nrequired to make red blood cells. The condition is defined as one in which\\nthe blood is deficient in red blood cells, in hemoglobin, or in total volume.\\nThis results in blood that is incapable of meeting the oxygen needs of\\nthe body’s tissues. Anemia is characterized by changes in the size and color\\nof red blood cells. Red blood cells, or erythrocytes, are primarily responsi-\\nble for oxygen transport from the lungs to the body’s many cells. Hemo-\\nglobin is an oxygen-carrying protein in the red blood cell that incorporates\\niron into its structure. Therefore, iron is an essential building block of blood\\nerythrocytes. When red blood cells are larger than normal, the anemia is\\ntermed macrocytic, and when they are smaller than normal, it is called mi-\\ncrocytic.

Adult diets in most of the developing world tend to be\\niron-poor, and a low dietary intake can result in iron deficiency. Deficiency\\ncan also occur as a result of poor iron absorption due to gastrointestinal\\npathology, blood loss due to normal menstruation, blood loss from para-\\nsitic infections such as hookworm and malaria, and blood loss from chronic\\ndiarrhea—all of which are common in developing countries.\\nOther Causes\\nThe two other primary causes of nutritional anemia are deficiencies in vit-\\namin B12 and folic acid, both of which are necessary for the production of\\nDNA, RNA, and protein. Without these necessary factors, red blood cells\\ncan develop abnormally, or even die prematurely in the bone marrow where\\nthey are made. This leads to what is known as megaloblastic anemia.\\nFolate deficiency is most often caused by poor intestinal absorption or\\nlow intake of folate-rich foods, such as human milk, cow’s milk, fruits, green\\nvegetables, and certain meats. It is also caused by congenital defects in in-\\ntestinal absorption. Just as with iron, folic acid requirements are highest dur-\\ning periods of rapid growth, particularly infancy and pregnancy.\\nFolate-deficient children present with common symptoms of anemia, as well\\nas chronic diarrhea.

A good amount of its absorption depends on the pres-\\nence of a substance called intrinsic factor (see sidebar). It does not normally\\noccur with kwashiorkor or marasmus. Both folate and vitamin B 12 deficien-\\ncies have also been linked to cardiovascular disease, mood disorders, and\\nincreased frequency of chromosomal breaks (which may contribute to the\\ndevelopment of cancer).\\nTreatment\\nEach of the important causes of nutritional anemia can be eradicated through\\nprevention and treatment.

The lack of intrinsic factor B 12 leads to vita-\\nmin B12 deficiency. It can also be caused by\\nphysiologic or anatomic disturbances of the\\nstomach that might prevent intrinsic factor\\nsecretion.

James\\nAntioxidants\\nAmericans spend several billion dollars a year on antioxidants in an effort\\nto improve their health. Science has been looking at antioxidants and their\\nrole in everything from preventing cancer and heart disease to boosting\\nthe immune system and slowing the aging process. Antioxidants provide a\\nlayer of protection for the cells and tissues of the body, just as a thick coat\\nof wax helps protect a car’s finish. Specifically, antioxidants protect against\\nfree radical damage. What are free radicals?\\nPeople must breathe in oxygen to live. Continuously on the move in\\nthe blood stream and transported to every cell, oxygen is necessary for all\\nessential bodily functions. However, a small amount of this oxygen gets loose\\nand produces unstable by-products called free radicals. Body processes, such\\nas metabolism, as well as environmental factors, including pollution and\\ncigarette smoke, can produce free radicals. An overload of free radicals in\\nthe body causes damage to the cells, ultimately resulting in disease and ac-\\ncelerated aging.\\nAntioxidant-rich food may help prevent various cancers, heart disease,\\nand diseases of aging. Vitamins C and E, carotenoids (including beta-\\ncarotene), and the mineral selenium are all powerful antioxidants found in\\nfood. Vitamin C, a water-soluble vitamin, is also known as ascorbic acid.\\nMost of the vitamin C in the diet (90%) comes from fruits and vegetables.\\nHowever, since vitamin C is water soluble, cooking can destroy the vitamin\\nC in a food.\\n42\\nAnthropometric Measurements\\nanthropometric: related to measure-\\nment of characteristics of the human\\nbody\\nbody mass index: weight in kilograms\\ndivided by square of the height in meters;\\na measure of body fat\\nantioxidant: substance that prevents ox-\\nidation, a damaging reaction with oxygen\\ncancer: uncontrolled cell growth\\nheart disease: any disorder of the heart\\nor its blood supply, including heart attack,\\natherosclerosis, and coronary artery \\ndisease\\nimmune system: the set of organs and\\ncells, including white blood cells, that\\nprotect the body from infection\\nfree radical: highly reactive molecular\\nfragment, which can damage cells\\noxygen: O2, atmospheric gas required\\nby all animals\\nmetabolism:the sum total of reactions\\nin a cell or an organism\\nvitamin:necessary complex nutrient\\nused to aid enzymes or other metabolic\\nprocesses in the cell\\ncarotenoid: plant-derived molecules\\nused as pigments\\nwater-soluble: able to be dissolved in\\nwater\\ndiet:the total daily food intake, or the\\ntypes of foods eaten'),\n",

Al-\\nthough the physiologicalreasons people feel hunger have not been clearly\\nidentified, the feeling of hunger rises and falls based on the activation of\\nneuralcircuitry related to eating. There are many chemical agents in the\\nhuman body that affect the sensation of hunger. Unfortunately for some\\npeople, eating behavior is not governed by hunger and satiety (feeling of\\nfullness), but by a variety of other factors.

Its trade name is Sunette. Two hun-\\ndred times sweeter than sucrose, this sweetener is stable when heated, mak-\\ning it suitable for cooking. However, when used in large amounts it has a\\nbitter aftertaste. It is not broken down by the body, and it does not pro-\\nvide any calories. Over ninety scientific studies have been conducted by the\\nFDA, and the World Health Organization’s Joint Expert Committee on\\nFood Additives(JECFA) has also endorsed Acesulfame K’s safety.\\nAspartame was discovered in 1969 and approved for use in the United\\nStates in 1981. Its trade name is NutraSweet. Also two hundred times sweeter\\nthan sugar, aspartame is not suitable in applications that require high tem-\\nperatures, as it loses its sweetness when heated. It contains four calories per\\ngram, but, because of its intense sweetness, the amount of energy derived\\nfrom it is negligible. It is synthesized from aspartic acid and phenylalanine,\\ntwo essential amino acids. Persons with the rare hereditary metabolic dis-\\norder phenylketonuria (PKU), an inborn error of metabolism, must con-\\ntrol their intake of phenylalanine from all sources, including aspartame, and\\ntherefore all U.S. products containing aspartame are labeled “This product\\ncontains phenylalanine.” Because it is impossible to know if an unborn child\\nhas PKU, it is recommended that pregnant women not use aspartame. The\\nFDA states that aspartame is the most thoroughly tested food additive ever\\nsubmitted to the agency.\\nNeotame was discovered in 1990 and was approved for use in the United\\nStates in 2002. Eight thousand times sweeter than sugar, this analog of as-\\npartame can be used in both cooking and baking applications.

Saccharin is approved in more than one hundred countries\\naround the world and has been reviewed and determined safe by the Joint\\nExpert Committee on Food Additives of the World Health Organization\\nand the Scientific Committee for Food of the European Union.\\nSucralose was discovered in 1976 and approved for use in the United\\nStates in 1988. Its trade name is Splenda. Six hundred times sweeter than\\nsugar, sucralose is not absorbed from the digestive tract, so it adds no calo-\\nries to consumed food. It is made from rearranged sugar molecules that\\nsubstitute three atoms of chlorine for three hydroxyl groups on the sugar\\nmolecule. Sucralose has been tested in more than one hundred studies.\\nSugar Alcohols (GRAS)\\nSugar alcohols are not technically artificial sweeteners. Examples include\\nsorbitol, xylitol, lactitol, mannitol, isomalt, and maltitol, which are used to\\nsweeten “sugar-free” foods such as candy, cookies, and chewing gum. The\\nalcohols have fewer calories than sugar, do not promote tooth decay, and\\ndo not cause a sudden increase in blood glucose because the bloodstream\\ndoes not easily absorb them. They may cause, however, effects similar to a\\nlaxative if consumed in excess. Products containing large amounts of sugar\\nalcohols must be labeled with the warning: “Excess consumption may have\\na laxative effect.”\\n47\\nArtificial Sweeteners\\nA few popular alternatives to table sugar\\ninclude sucralose, aspartame, and\\nsaccharin. Despite controversy over\\npotential health risks related to their\\nconsumption, each of these products has\\nundergone a decade or more of scientific\\ntesting and is generally recognized as\\nsafe.

Rice is the mainstay of the diet and is commonly eaten at every\\nmeal.\\nThe traditional Asian diet has received a lot of attention because many\\nchronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers, are\\nnot as common in Asia as in the United States and other Western nations.\\nResearchers believe that the Asian plant-based diet provides protection\\nagainst these chronic diseases. The diet is also believed to contribute to the\\nlong life spans commonly seen in Asia. To offer a healthful alternative to\\nthe 1992 U.S. Food Guide Pyramid, which lumped some animal and plant\\nfoods together in a single group, researchers developed an Asian Diet Pyra-\\nmid, which emphasizes a wide base of rice, rice products, noodles, breads\\nand grains, preferably whole grain and minimally processed foods, topped\\nby another large band of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Daily\\nphysical exercise, a small amount of vegetable oil, and a moderate con-\\nsumption of plant-based beverages—including tea (especially black and\\ngreen), sake, beer, and wine—are also recommended daily. Small daily serv-\\nings of low-fat dairy products or fish are optional; sweets, eggs, and poul-\\ntry are recommended no more than weekly; and red meat is recommended\\nno more than monthly.\\nThe Asian Diet Pyramid reflects the traditional, plant-based rural diets\\nof Asia. Although there is an image of Asian Americans as a “model minor-\\nity” who have overcome their “ethnic handicap” and are socioeconomically\\nwell off (Chen and Hawks), certain illnesses predominate in this group. For\\nexample, there is a particularly high rate of liver cancer among Asian Amer-\\nicans, while lung cancer is their leading cause of death.

Asian Indian immigrants in the United States have\\nan unusually high rate of coronary artery disease, and parasitic infections\\nare particularly widespread among Southeast Asian refugees.\\nStudies indicate that the food habits of Asians become increasingly\\nWesternized after they move to the United States or other Western coun-\\ntries (see Karim, Bloch, Falciglia, and Murthy). There is a general shift from\\nvegetarianism to nonvegetarianism, and ethnic foods are consumed along\\nwith traditional ingredients found in American supermarkets. Consequently,\\ndiets of immigrants living in the United States have changed from being\\nlow in fat and rich in fiber to being high in saturated fat and animal pro-\\ntein and low in fiber. There is also an increased tendency to consume fast\\nfoods and convenience foods.

In addition, the geography and climate of Asia are as diverse as its\\nnations and peoples. From the lush rice paddies of the Philippines to the\\ncrowded Tokyo metropolis to the rainforests of Indonesia, there is a stag-\\ngering variety of fruit, food, and spices in this extraordinary part of the\\nworld. Asia can be divided into three regions: East Asia (including China,\\nTaiwan, Japan, and Korea); Southeast Asia (including Malaysia, Singapore,\\nand the Philippines); and South Asia (including India and Sri Lanka).\\nThe Thread that Binds Asia: Rice\\nThough each Asian country and region has its distinct flavors and cooking\\nstyles, almost all share one food in common—rice. But rice is not eaten in\\nthe same manner in each country. As a staple food central to survival, es-\\npecially during times of famine, rice has acquired an almost sacred status\\nin Asian society, and it is served in many ways. It is cooked as a significant\\npart of each meal of the day, incorporated as a main ingredient in confec-\\ntions such as candy and cakes, fermented to make wine (Japanese sake) or\\nbeer, or sometimes given as an offering to the gods to ensure a good har-\\nvest. Rice is a potent culinary and spiritual staple in Asia.\\nAsian Fruit\\nThe fruits of Asia are unlike those of any other part of the world. The trop-\\nical climate of South and Southeast Asia, and the mild climate of East Asia,\\ncreate a hospitable environment for many different fruits to grow. Fruit is\\na significant part of the Asian diet and is usually eaten as a dessert with\\nlunch or dinner. In East Asia, oranges, quince, dates, pears, strawberries,\\ncherries, watermelon, peaches, and grapefruit are eaten widely. In South and\\nSoutheast Asia, there are unique fruits such as sweet mangoes (originally\\n52\\nAsians, Diet of\\nfamine: extended period of food shortage\\ndiet: the total daily food intake, or the\\ntypes of foods eaten'),\n",

Coconut milk is used\\nfor curries in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, South India, Myanmar, and the\\nPhilippines. It is also a delicious beverage, and is often drunk straight from\\nthe coconut with a straw. Coconut meat is added to desserts and salads.\\nOther tropical fruits found in Asia include guava, papaya, pawpaw, starfruit\\n(carambola), mangosteen, sour sop, jackfruit, longan, rambutan, durian,\\npineapple, and lychee.\\nOther Common Ingredients Used across Asia\\nNuts are popular in Asia, eaten plain as snacks or mashed into porridge and\\nsauces. In Malaysia and Indonesia, satays (peanut-based sauces) flavor\\nchicken and beef dishes. The Chinese bake almond cookies and make rice\\ncream with almonds or hazelnuts. Steamed cakes with almonds or maca-\\ndamias are also common, and rice puddings with fruit, raisins, almonds, wal-\\nnuts, or hazelnuts are popular desserts in India. Both East and Southeast\\nAsia boast stir-fry dishes with peanuts, while India flavors its rice with lemon\\nand peanuts.\\nEast Asian Food\\nChina. Different regions of China have distinct tastes in food. Shang-\\nhainese cooking is known for its spicy chili flavoring and trademark red-\\ncolored meats. The Cantonese and Chaozhao regions are known for cooked\\nmeats and vegetables; and in the Beijing, Mandarin, and Shandong regions\\nsteamed bread and noodles are used as staples instead of rice. The most\\nprized food staples in China are rice and wheat, though yams, taros, and\\npotatoes are eaten when rice and wheat are not available. Chinese vegeta-\\nbles are mostly imported from Central Asia, including cucumbers, corian-\\nder, peas, sesame, onions, grapes and pomegranates, tomatoes, maize, sweet\\npotatoes, peanuts, mushrooms, and daikon (radish). Preserved foods are\\npopular, including pickled foods, fermented vegetables, and smoked and\\nsalted meats. Other well-known seasonings that are used include salted black\\nbeans (douchi), sweet and salty sauce, garlic, oyster sauce, soy sauce, black\\nfungus, chilies, hoisin sauce, ginger, sesame seeds, and sesame oil.\\nThe Chinese cook most of their food by mincing the ingredients and\\nsautéing them in a deep pan called a wok. Little fat is used to season the\\nmeals, but plenty of fresh flavorings are added, such as ginger, chilies, soy\\nsauces, scallions, oyster sauce, and fagara (Szechuan pepper). In the cities,\\nmost people cook over a gas stovetop, while in the country they use a brick\\nstove to cook several dishes at once, including the rice. Tea is the most com-\\nmon beverage, though sodas are also popular.\\nJapan. Sushi (slices of raw fish on rice), teriyaki meats, and tempura (batter-\\nfried vegetables or shrimp) are not the only foods in the Japanese diet.

Other well-liked drinks are made from barley, corn\\nrice, sesame seeds, ginseng, ginger, cinnamon, and citron.\\nSoutheast Asia\\nSoutheast Asia is located in the monsoon belt, where heavy rains fall for sev-\\neral months a year. Most Southeast Asian countries use plenty of spice and\\ncoconut in their dishes, except for Vietnam.\\nVietnam. Vietnamese cuisine does not include large amounts of meat and\\nfish; instead, rice is supplemented with vegetables and eggs. Similar to Chi-\\nnese cooking, Vietnamese cooking uses little fat or oil for frying. Instead of\\nusing soy sauce for seasoning, nuocmam (fish sauce) is used as the main fla-\\nvoring in almost every dish. Pho is a type of soup in which noodles, beef,\\nchicken, or pork are added, and the soup is then garnished with basil, bean\\nsprouts, and other seasonings. Fruits are an integral part of each meal—\\nbananas, mangoes, papayas, oranges, coconuts, and pineapple are all popu-\\nlar. Vietnamese coffee is made with condensed milk to make the drink ex-\\ntra sweet and delicious. Hot green tea is very popular as well.\\nThe Philippines.

In the Philippines,\\nfour meals a day are served: breakfast, lunch, merienda (snack), and dinner.\\nPancit, or noodles, is considered a merienda dish and is served with a sponge-\\ncake called puto and a glutinous ricecake called cuchinta. Lunch is the heav-\\niest meal and consists of rice, a vegetable, a meat, and sometimes fish as\\nwell. Vegetables include kangkung (a local spinach), broccoli, Chinese broc-\\ncoli, bitter melon, mung bean, beansprouts, eggplant, and okra.

In areas of famine,\\nor where insufficient varieties of foods are available, certain populations\\n(such as pregnant women, infants, and growing children) are often at high\\nrisk for nutritional deficiencies.\\nVitamin A. Vitamin A is necessary to develop a strong immune system\\nand proper eyesight. Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) not only causes blindness\\nand visual impairment (e.g., cataract), but also growth retardation and sus-\\nceptibility to infections. When VAD is not detected early, it may make a\\nchild more prone to illness and even death. In Asia alone, it is estimated\\nthat 125 million children under five years of age are currently at risk, and\\n1.3 million are reported to be vitamin A deficient.\\nIodine Deficiency Disorder (IDD). Iodine is essential for pregnant\\nwomen, infants, and young children because it regulates the production of\\nhormonesnecessary for children’s development. Providing the recom-\\nmended daily amount of iodine to mothers and children helps prevent brain\\ndamage, stunted growth, and goiters (ball-shaped tumors on the neck) in\\nchildren. Some children with IDD are unable to move normally, speak, or\\nhear. Asia has an estimated 200 million people at risk of IDDs.\\nIron Deficiency and Anemia. Iron deficiency is the most common mi-\\ncronutrient deficiency in the world. The consequences of iron deficiency\\ninclude impaired cognitive development. Iron deficiency is the most com-\\nmon cause of anemia (low levels of red blood cells or hemoglobin) in Asia,\\nwith over 600 million people affected. Young children, adolescent girls, and\\nwomen are the most severely affected. Southeast Asia has the largest pro-\\nportion of anemia—about 600 million are at risk for iron deficiency in this\\nregion.\\nLactose Intolerance. Historically, milk and dairy products have not\\nbeen used in East and Southeast Asia. As a result, the hereditary ability to\\ndigest lactose is most common in Asia and parts of Africa. Milk and dairy\\nproducts are a major source of calcium, and people who avoid them be-\\ncause of lactose intolerance may compromise their nutritional status and\\nbone strength. Low-lactose milk products have been developed to reduce\\nthe symptoms of lactose intolerance (diarrhea, abdominal bloating and gas,\\nand stomach cramps).\\nThe Nutritional Transition and Its Health Effects\\nWith people living longer, and with low birth weight at an all-time low,\\nAsian health should be improving. But with increased Westernization of the\\nAsian diet, elevated tobacco use (generally among Asian men), and lifestyle\\nchanges (such as decreased physical activity), there has been a marked rise\\nin cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus, hypertension ( high\\nblood pressure), and certain cancers. Obesity is also a growing health prob-\\nlem in Asia, and is strongly associated with hypertension (along with body\\nmass index and age). Despite the low obesity levels in the Asia Pacific re-\\ngion, rates of obesity-related diseases such as diabetes and CVD are on the\\nrise. High blood pressure is also a growing problem in Asia. In India, In-\\ndonesia, and Thailand alone, nearly 10 to 15 percent of adults have high\\n56\\nAsians, Diet of\\nnutritional deficiency: lack of adequate\\nnutrients in the diet\\nimmune system: the set of organs and\\ncells, including white blood cells, that\\nprotect the body from infection\\ncataract: clouding of the lens of the eye\\nhormone: molecules produced by one\\nset of cells that influence the function of\\nanother set of cells\\nhemoglobin: the iron-containing molecule\\nin red blood cells that carries oxygen\\ncalcium: mineral essential for bones and\\nteeth\\ncardiovascular: related to the heart and\\ncirculatory system\\ndiabetes: inability to regulate level of\\nsugar in the blood\\nhigh blood pressure: elevation of the\\npressure in the bloodstream maintained\\nby the heart\\nobesity: the condition of being over-\\nweight, according to established norms\\nbased on sex, age, and height\\nbody mass index: weight in kilograms\\ndivided by square of the height in meters;\\na measure of body fat'),\n",

It is a progressive disease of the large- and medium-sized\\narteries. The name is derived from the Greek athero meaning “gruel” or\\n“paste” and sclerosis meaning “hardening.” Thus, atherosclerosis is the hard-\\nening of the arteries due to the accumulation of this paste (commonly called\\nplaque).\\nAny vessel in the body may be affected; however, the aorta, coronary,\\ncarotid, and iliac arteries are most frequently affected. When the coronary\\narteries are involved, it results in coronary artery disease (CAD). Harden-\\ning of the arteries is due to the build up of plaque and mineral deposits. As\\na result, the supply of blood to the heart is reduced, which can lead to chest\\npain or a myocardial infarction (heart attack). Hardening of the arteries\\ncauses an increase in resistance to blood flow and, therefore, an increase in\\nblood pressure.\\nEveryone gets atherosclerosis. It is said that if every person lived to be\\n100 years old, each would eventually die of atherosclerosis. The process be-\\ngins early in life. Therefore, physicians should obtain risk-factor profiles and\\na family history for children. Surgical procedures such as angioplasty and\\ncardiac bypass may restore cardiovascular function. However, prevention\\nis the key. Smoking, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, a high-\\nfat diet, and lack of physical activity are the most serious risk factors for\\natherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases. Controlling one of these\\nrisk factors can help control the others. For example, regular exercise can\\nhelp control cholesterol, blood pressure, weight, and stress levels. Smok-\\ning is the most preventable risk factor. For some, a low-dose aspirin taken\\ndaily is recommended for adults over age forty to thin the blood.\\nFor optimal health, health professionals recommend a change to a\\nhealthful diet and lifestyle for those at risk, including daily physical activ-\\nity; smoking cessation; a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet; reducing sodium\\nintake; and managing stress.

The remaining amount cannot\\nbe metabolized and is removed as waste. The ability to absorb nutrients\\nvaries by gender, disease state, and physiologic condition (e.g., pregnancy,\\naging). The bioavailability of a nutrient can also increase or decrease if other\\nsubstances are present. For example, calcium and magnesium lose much of\\ntheir effectiveness if taken with fatty foods.

In recent years, however, food biotechnology has be-\\ncome synonymous with the terms genetically engineered foods and genetically\\nmodified organism (GMO).\\nTraditional biotechnology uses techniques such as crossbreeding, fer-\\nmentation, and enzymatic treatments to produce desired changes in plants,\\nanimals, and foods. Crossbreeding plants or animals involves the selective\\npassage of desirable genes from one generation to another. Microbial fer-\\nmentation is used in making wine and other alcoholic beverages, yogurt,\\nand many cheeses and breads. Using enzymes as food additives is another\\ntraditional form of biotechnology. For example, papain, an enzyme obtained\\nfrom papaya fruit, is used to tenderize meat and clarify beverages.\\nGenetic Engineering\\nThe DNA contained in genes determines inherited characteristics. Modi-\\nfying DNA to remove, add, or alter genetic information is called genetic\\nmodification or genetic engineering. In the early 1980s, scientists developed\\nrecombinant DNA techniques that allowed them to extract DNA from one\\nspecies and insert it into another. Refinements in these techniques have al-\\nlowed identification of specific genes within DNA—and the transfer of that\\nparticular gene sequence of DNA into another species. For example, the\\ngenes responsible for producing insulin in humans have been isolated and\\ninserted into bacteria. The insulin that is then produced by these bacteria,\\nwhich is identical to human insulin, is then isolated and given to people who\\nhave diabetes. Similarly, the genes that produce chymosin, an enzyme that\\nis involved in cheese manufacturing, have also been inserted into bacteria.\\nNow, instead of having to extract chymosin from the stomachs of cows, it\\nis made by bacteria. This type of application of genetic engineering has not\\nbeen very controversial. However, applications involving the use of plants\\nhave been more controversial.\\nAmong the first commercial applications of genetically engineered foods\\nwas a tomato in which the gene that produces the enzyme responsible for\\nsoftening was turned off. The tomato could then be allowed to ripen on the\\nvine without getting too soft to be packed and shipped. As of 2002, over\\nforty food crops had been modified using recombinant DNA technology,\\nincluding pesticide-resistant soybeans, virus-resistant squash, frost-resistant\\nstrawberries, corn and potatoes containing a natural pesticide, and rice con-\\ntaining beta-carotene. Consumer negativity toward biotechnology is in-\\ncreasing, not only in the United States, but also in the United Kingdom,\\nJapan, Germany, and France, despite increased consumer knowledge of\\nbiotechnology. The principle objections to biotechnology and foods pro-\\nduced using genetic modification are: concern about possible harm to hu-\\nman health (such as allergic responses to a “foreign gene”), possible negative\\nimpact to the environment, a general unease about the “unnatural” status\\nof biotechnology, and religious concerns about modification.\\nBiotechnology in Animals\\nThe most controversial applications of biotechnology involve the use of\\nanimals and the transfer of genes from animals to plants.

SEE ALSO Anthropometric\\nMeasurements; Body Image; Obesity; Waist-to-Hip Ratio; Weight\\nManagement.\\nDiane L. Golzynski\\nBody Image\\nThe term body image refers to the view that a person has of his or her own\\nbody size and proportion. Body-image distortion occurs when a person’s\\nview of their body is significantly different from reality.\\nMany factors impact the perception of one’s body image, including the\\nmass media, peer groups, ethnic groups, and family values. There is no such\\nthing as an “ideal” or “perfect” body, and different cultures have different\\nstandards and norms for appropriate body size and shape. Even within a\\nparticular culture, societal standards shift periodically. For example, in the\\nUnited States, the value of being thin has been the predominant stereotype\\nfor women since the model Twiggy arrived on the scene in the 1960s. The\\naverage fashion model (at the beginning of the twenty-first century) is al-\\nmost six feet tall and weighs 130 pounds, whereas the average American\\nwoman is five feet, four inches tall and weighs 140 pounds. This disparity\\nin height and weight may lead to problems with self-esteem when a woman\\nfinds herself not meeting the cultural ideal of body size and shape. The in-\\nteresting factor is that women tend to feel overweight, not “under height”\\nwhen comparing themselves to fashion models.\\nAnother example of body-image distortion can be seen among the con-\\ntestants in the Miss America Beauty Pageant, the Miss Universe Pageant,\\nand the Miss World Pageant. No winner of these pageants has ever been\\n“overweight,” and the winners have gotten progressively thinner over the\\nyears. Magazines and other media convey the image that being thin equates\\nto being happy and successful, while cases of weight discrimination have\\nbeen identified and argued in the courts. Fortunately, more emphasis is now\\nbeing placed on health at any size, and on women becoming more muscu-\\nlar and fit, rather than simply thin. With increases in obesity statistics, how-\\never, some people may feel even more pressure to lose weight due to\\nbody-image distortion.\\nThere are normal and predictable periods in life when body-image dis-\\ntortion occurs. One of these is puberty, when rapid changes in body size,\\nbody shape, and secondary sex characteristics take place. During this time,\\nfemales tend to gain fat in the breasts, hips, buttocks, and thighs, develop-\\ning a more pear-shaped body. Adolescent females may view their bodies as\\nbeing heavier than they actually are, especially when compared to fashion\\nmodels or celebrities. Adolescent males tend to gain height and muscle mass\\nduring puberty, and they may view their bodies as smaller than they actu-\\nally are when compared to bodybuilders or professional athletes.\\nBody-image distortion also occurs when eating disorders develop. Most\\nexperts agree that the development of eating disorders is multifactorial and\\nincludes sociocultural, psychological, hereditary, and brain chemistry ef-\\nfects. Society plays a role in their development since eating disorders occur\\n69\\nBody Image\\noverweight: weight above the accepted\\nnorm based on height, sex, and age\\nobesity: the condition of being over-\\nweight, according to established norms\\nbased on sex, age, and height\\npuberty: time of onset of sexual maturity\\npsychological: related to thoughts, feel-\\nings, and personal experiences'),\n",

Another characteristic associated with body-\\nimage dissatisfaction, dieting, and binge eating is low self-esteem.\\nThe earlier the treatment or intervention in eating disorders occurs, the\\nbetter the prognosis is. With early diagnosis and treatment, body-image dis-\\ntortion may be minimal and can return to normal. The goals of body-image\\ntreatment are to correct distortions in body image and create a more posi-\\ntive body image.

The\\nBMI has also been associated with mortality, with lower values generally\\ncorrelating with longer life.\\nHowever, when evaluating the BMI, several characteristics of an indi-\\nvidual need to be known.

As with most assessment tools, the BMI is most effective when used\\nin conjunction with other measurements.\\nTables are available to identify the significance of the BMI. Calcula-\\ntions based on values for ideal body weight suggest the BMI for normal men\\nand women should be in the range of 19 to 27 kg/m2. This range corre-\\nsponds to the 25th to 75th percentile values recorded from adults followed\\nin the 1971–1974 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\\n(NHANES). Tables also list levels of protein-energy malnutrition and obe-\\nsity. These values were determined by research in which height, weight, and\\nage were associated with functional measurements and health outcomes.\\nA BMI between 13 and 15 corresponds to 48 to 55 percent of desirable\\nbody weight for a given height and describes the lowest body weight that\\ncan sustain life. Body weight at this level consists of less than 5 percent fat.\\nThe maximum survival body weight is about 500 kg, which corresponds to\\na BMI of about 150.\\nResearch with children indicates annual increases in BMI are usually\\ndue to increases in lean mass rather than fat tissue.

For example, athletes usually have large skeletal muscles (which\\nweigh more than fat) and therefore a high BMI, but they are not obese.\\nShorter individuals can also be identified as obese, since their BMIs are usu-\\nally high. An older individual may have a higher body-fat percentage than\\na younger individual, but have the same BMI.

Height decreases over an individual’s lifetime\\ndue to vertebral compression, loss of muscle tone, and postural slump. An\\nindividual may, therefore, report a height that is no longer accurate, and the\\nresulting value will be lower than the value that actually describes the indi-\\nvidual, possibly leading to the wrong intervention.\\nResearch has shown that both high BMIs and low BMIs can indicate in-\\ncreased morbidityand mortality. A low BMI, usually an indication of protein-\\nenergy malnutrition or the effects of wasting or a disease process, is a\\nsignificant predictor of mortality among young and old hospitalized patients.\\nA high BMI has been shown to be predictive of mortality only among young\\nhospitalized patients, usually an effect of cardiovascular disease and obe-\\nsity.

Com-\\nparisons between BMI and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) mea-\\nsurements show that they identify the same level of malnutrition in\\nindividuals. MUAC is also easily measured (it requires only a tape measure),\\nand it is a good indicator of change in body weight and muscle mass. Stan-\\ndardization of these two assessment tools for reference would benefit the\\nscience of nutrition assessment.

Most health organizations recommend infants be ex-\\nclusively breastfed during the first four to six months of life, but ideally\\nthrough the first year. Premature infants also benefit from their mothers’\\nmilk. In developing countries, breastfeeding up to age two, with appropri-\\nate supplementary solid foods, maintains good nutritional status and pre-\\nvents diarrhea.\\nBenefits of Breastfeeding\\nHuman milk contains the right balance of nutrients for human growth and\\ndevelopment. It is low in total protein and high in carbohydrates, making\\nit more digestible and less stressful on the immature kidneys. In addition,\\neach mammal produces milk that is nutritionally and immunologically tai-\\nlored for its young. In rare cases, such as galactosemia and phenylketonuria,\\nsome infants cannot metabolize human milk or other milk products. A sig-\\nnificant benefit of human milk is that it contains many immunologic agents\\nthat protect the infant against bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Breastfeed-\\ning also provides many benefits for the mother.\\nBreastfeeding Trends\\nDespite the many benefits of breastfeeding, only 64 percent of mothers in\\nthe United States initiate breastfeeding, with 29 percent still breastfeeding\\nsix months after birth. The U.S. goals for 2000 were to increase to 75 per-\\ncent the proportion of women who initiate breastfeeding, and to increase\\nto 50 percent the proportion of women who breastfeed for five to six months.\\nIn the United States, ethnic minorities are less likely to breastfeed than their\\nwhite counterparts.\\nBased on a 2001 report by the World Health Organization (WHO), 35\\npercent of infants worldwide are exclusively breastfed (no other food or drink,\\nnot even water) for the first four months of life. Rates are very low in a num-\\nber of African countries, especially Nigeria, Central African Republic, and\\nNiger. Some countries, such as Benin, Mali, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have\\nhad small increases, due mainly to breastfeeding campaigns, baby-friendly\\nhospitals, and the commitment of trained breastfeeding counselors. In South-\\neast Asia, the exclusive breastfeeding rate, though low, has increased. Breast-\\nfeeding rates are also low in many European countries, especially France,\\nItaly, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

Suckling by the infant\\nstimulates the release of prolactin. The size of the breasts is not a factor in\\nmilk production. Oxytocin, another hormone, allows the breast tissue to “let\\ndown” or release milk from the milk ducts to the nipples.\\nColostrum, the first milk produced, has all the nutrients a newborn infant\\nneeds. It also contains many substances to protect against infections. The body\\nproduces colostrum for several days until the “mature milk” comes in. Mature\\nmilk adjusts to the baby’s needs for the rest of the time the infant is breastfed.\\nNutritional Needs of the Mother\\nMilk production requires about 800 calories a day. The Recommended\\nDietary Allowances for calories during breastfeeding is 500 more calories\\na day than is required by a nonpregnant woman. Nutritional requirements\\ndo not change significantly from pregnancy, with the exception of decreases\\nin folate and iron, and increases in vitamin A, vitamin C, niacin, and zinc.\\nThe diet can be the same as during pregnancy, plus an additional glass of\\nmilk. Women who are on medication should check with their physicians,\\nsince most drugs are absorbed in breast milk.\\nWeaning\\nThe decision to wean should be based on the desires and needs of the mother\\nand child. Weaning should be gradual. Women returning to work can pump\\nand store their milk for later use. Solid foods should be given based on the\\nage and developmental stage of the child. In some countries, many toddlers\\nbecome malnourished because they are given too many high carbohydrate\\nfoods, such as cassava, potatoes, and other root vegetables, too early. These\\nfoods are filling, but they are low in protein and other nutrients essential\\nfor growth and development.\\nBreast Implants and Breast Reduction\\nMany women with breast implants breastfeed successfully, though it is not\\nknown whether the health of the infant is affected by breast implants.\\n76\\nBreastfeeding\\nhormone: molecules produced by one\\nset of cells that influence the function of\\nanother set of cells\\ncalorie: unit of food energy\\nRecommended Dietary Allowances:\\nnutrient intake recommended to promote\\nhealth\\nnutritional requirements: the set of\\nsubstances needed in the diet to main-\\ntain health\\nfolate: one of the B vitamins, also called\\nfolic acid\\niron:nutrient needed for red blood cell\\nformation\\nniacin: one of the B vitamins, required\\nfor energy production in the cell\\nzinc: mineral necessary for many enzyme\\nprocesses\\ndiet:the total daily food intake, or the\\ntypes of foods eaten\\ndrugs:substances whose administration\\ncauses a significant change in the body’s\\nfunction\\nwean: cease breast-feeding\\nmalnourished: lack of adequate nutrients\\nin the diet'),\n",

Saunders.\\nCaffeine\\nCaffeine is a naturally occurring stimulant found in the leaves, seeds, or fruit\\nof over sixty plants around the world. Caffeine exists in the coffee bean in\\nArabia, the tea leaf in China, the kola nut in West Africa, and the cocoa\\nbean in Mexico. Because of its use throughout all societies, caffeine is the\\nmost widely used psychoactive substance in the world. The most common\\ncaffeine sources in North America and Europe are coffee and tea. Since\\nabout 1980, extensive research has been conducted on how caffeine affects\\nhealth. Most experts agree that moderate use of caffeine (300 milligrams, or\\nabout three cups of coffee, per day) is not likely to cause health problems.\\nHow Caffeine Affects the Body\\nCaffeine is best known for its stimulant, or “wake-up,” effect. Once a per-\\nson consumes caffeine, it is readily absorbed by the body and carried around\\nin the bloodstream, where its level peaks about one hour after consumption.\\nCaffeine mildly stimulates the nervous and cardiovascular systems. It af-\\nfects the brain and results in elevated mood, decreased fatigue, and increased\\nattentiveness, so a person can think more clearly and work harder. It also\\nincreases the heart rate, blood flow, respiratory rate, and metabolic rate for\\nseveral hours. When taken before bedtime, caffeine can interfere with get-\\nting to sleep or staying asleep.\\nExactly how caffeine will affect an individual, and for how long, depends\\non many factors, including the amount of caffeine ingested, whether one is\\nmale or female, one’s height and weight, one’s age, and whether one is preg-\\nnant or smokes. Caffeine is converted by the liver into substances that are\\nexcreted in the urine.\\nSome people are more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than others.\\nWith frequent use, tolerance to many of the effects of caffeine will develop.\\nAt doses of 600 milligrams (about six cups of coffee) or more daily, caffeine\\ncan cause nervousness, sweating, tenseness, upset stomach, anxiety, and in-\\nsomnia. It can also prevent clear thinking and increase the side effects of\\ncertain medications. This level of caffeine intake represents a significant\\nhealth risk.\\nCaffeine can be mildly addictive. Even when moderate amounts of caf-\\nfeine are withdrawn for 18 to 24 hours, one may feel symptoms such as\\nheadache, fatigue, irritability, depression, and poor concentration. The\\nsymptoms peak within 24 to 48 hours and progressively decrease over the\\ncourse of a week. To minimize withdrawal symptoms, experts recommend\\nreducing caffeine intake gradually.\\n80\\nCaffeine\\nC\\ncardiovascular: related to the heart and\\ncirculatory system\\nfatigue: tiredness\\nmetabolic: related to processing of nutri-\\nents and building of necessary molecules\\nwithin the cell\\ntolerance: development of a need for \\nincreased amount of drug to obtain a\\ngiven level of intoxication\\nanxiety: nervousness\\ndepression: mood disorder characterized\\nby apathy, restlessness, and negative\\nthoughts'),\n",

The accom-\\npanying table displays the amount of caffeine in foods. An eight-ounce cup\\nof drip-brewed coffee has about 85 milligrams of caffeine, whereas the same\\namount of brewed tea contains about 47 milligrams. Twelve-ounce cans of\\nsoft drinks (soda) provide about 35 to 45 milligrams of caffeine.\\nThe caffeine content of coffee and tea depends on the variety of the cof-\\nfee bean or tea leaf, the particle size, the brewing method, and the length\\nof brewing or steeping time. Brewed coffee has more caffeine than instant\\ncoffee, and espresso has more caffeine than brewed coffee. Espresso is made\\nby forcing hot pressurized water through finely ground, dark-roast beans.\\nBecause it is brewed with less water, it contains more caffeine than regular\\ncoffee per fluid ounce.\\nIn soft drinks, caffeine is both a natural and an added ingredient. About\\n5 percent of the caffeine in colas and pepper-flavored soft drinks is obtained\\nnaturally from cola nuts; the remaining 95 percent is added. Caffeine-free\\ndrinks contain virtually no caffeine and make up a small part of the soft-\\ndrink market.\\nNumerous prescription and nonprescription drugs also contain caffeine.\\nCaffeine increases the ability of aspirin and other painkillers to do their job,\\nand it is often used in headache and pain-relief remedies as well as in cold\\nproducts and alertness or stay-awake tablets.

It accounts for 1 to 2 percent of\\nadult body weight, 99 percent of which is stored in bones and teeth. On\\nthe cellular level, calcium is used to regulate the permeability and electri-\\ncal properties of biological membranes (such as cell walls), which in turn\\ncontrol muscle and nerve functions, glandular secretions, and blood ves-\\nsel dilation and contraction. Calcium is also essential for proper blood\\nclotting.\\nBecause of its biological importance, calcium levels are carefully con-\\ntrolled in various compartments of the body. The three major regulators of\\nblood calcium are parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D, and calcitonin.\\nPTH is normally released by the four parathyroid glands in the neck in re-\\nsponse to low calcium levels in the bloodstream (hypocalcemia). PTH acts\\nin three main ways: (1) It causes the gastrointestinal tract to increase cal-\\ncium absorption from food, (2) it causes the bones to release some of their\\n83\\nCalcium\\ncalorie: unit of food energy\\ncalcium: mineral essential for bones and\\nteeth\\ndiet: the total daily food intake, or the\\ntypes of foods eaten\\nmetabolic:related to processing of nutri-\\nents and building of necessary molecules\\nwithin the cell\\nbiological: related to living organisms\\nblood clotting: the process by which\\nblood forms a solid mass to prevent un-\\ncontrolled bleeding\\nhormone: molecules produced by one\\nset of cells that influence the function of\\nanother set of cells\\nvitamin D: nutrient needed for calcium\\nuptake and therefore proper bone for-\\nmation\\ngastrointestinal: related to the stomach\\nand intestines\\nabsorption: uptake by the digestive tract'),\n",

Vitamin D can either be\\nobtained from the diet or produced in the skin when it is exposed to sun-\\nlight. Insufficient vitamin D from these sources can result in rickets in\\nchildren and osteomalacia in adults, conditions that result in bone de-\\nformities. Calcitonin, a hormone released by the thyroid, parathyroid, and\\nthymus glands, lowers blood levels by promoting the deposition of cal-\\ncium into bone.\\nMost dietary calcium is absorbed in the small intestine and transported\\nin the bloodstream bound to albumin, a simple protein. Because of this\\nmethod of transport, levels of albumin can also influence blood calcium mea-\\nsurements. Calcium is deposited in bone with phosphorous in a crystalline\\nform of calcium phosphate.\\nDeficiency and Toxicity\\nBecause bone stores of calcium can be used to maintain adequate blood cal-\\ncium levels, short-term dietary deficiency of calcium generally does not re-\\nsult in significantly low blood calcium levels. But, over the long term,\\ndietary deficiency eventually depletes bone stores, rendering the bones weak\\nand prone to fracture. A low blood calcium level is more often the result\\nof a disturbance in the body’s calcium regulating mechanisms, such as in-\\nsufficient PTH or vitamin D, rather than dietary deficiency. When calcium\\nlevels fall too low, nerve and muscle impairments can result. Skeletal mus-\\ncles can spasm and the heart can beat abnormally—it can even cease func-\\ntioning.\\nToxicity from calcium is not common because the gastrointestinal tract\\nnormally limits the amount of calcium absorbed. Therefore, short-term in-\\ntake of large amounts of calcium does not generally produce any ill effects\\naside from constipation and an increased risk of kidney stones. However,\\nmore severe toxicity can occur when excess calcium is ingested over long\\nperiods, or when calcium is combined with increased amounts of vitamin\\nD, which increases calcium absorption. Calcium toxicity is also sometimes\\nfound after excessive intravenous administration of calcium. Toxicity is\\nmanifested by abnormal deposition of calcium in tissues and by elevated\\nblood calcium levels (hypercalcemia). However, hypercalcemia is often due\\nto other causes, such as abnormally high amounts of PTH. Usually, under\\nthese circumstances, bone density is lost and the resulting hypercalcemia\\ncan cause kidney stones and abdominal pain. Some cancers can also cause\\nhypercalcemia, either by secreting abnormal proteins that act like PTH or\\nby invading and killing bone cells causing them to release calcium. Very high\\nlevels of calcium can result in appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal\\npain, confusion, seizures, and even coma.\\nRequirements and Supplementation\\nDietary calcium requirements depend in part upon whether the body is\\ngrowing or making new bone or milk. Requirements are therefore greatest\\nduring childhood, adolescence, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. Recom-\\nmended daily intake (of elemental calcium) varies accordingly: 400 mg for\\n84\\nCalcium\\nrickets: disorder caused by vitamin D\\ndeficiency, marked by soft and misshapen\\nbones and organ swelling\\nosteomalacia: softening of the bones\\nprotein: complex molecule composed of\\namino acids that performs vital functions\\nin the cell; necessary part of the diet\\nconstipation: difficulty passing feces\\nkidney stones: deposits of solid material\\nin kidney\\nintravenous: into the veins\\nnausea: unpleasant sensation in the gut\\nthat precedes vomiting\\nelemental: made from predigested nutri-\\nents'),\n",

Vitamin D is necessary for intestinal\\nabsorption, making Vitamin D–fortified milk a very well-absorbed form of\\ncalcium. Older persons may not consume or make as much vitamin D as is\\noptimal, so their calcium absorption may be decreased. Vitamin C and lac-\\ntose (the sugar found in milk) enhance calcium absorption, whereas meals\\nhigh in fat or protein may decrease absorption. Excess phosphorous con-\\nsumption (as in carbonated sodas) can decrease calcium absorption in the\\nintestines. High dietary fiber and phytate (a form of phytic acid found in\\ndietary fiber and the husks of whole grains) may also decrease dietary cal-\\ncium absorption in some areas of the world.

About one hundred human cancers\\nare recognized. The four most common cancers in the United States are: lung,\\ncolon/rectum, breast, and prostate. Together, these cancers account for over\\n50 percent of total cancer cases in the United States each year.\\nThere is a marked variation among countries in incidence of different\\ncancers. Most of the variation in cancer risk among populations, and among\\nindividuals, is due to environmental factors, such as cigarette smoking and\\ncertain dietary patterns, that can affect one’s risk of developing cancer. For\\nexample, individuals living in Australia have the highest worldwide lifetime\\nrisk of skin cancer, at over 20 percent, due to the high level of exposure to\\nthe sun of people in Australia. People in India have twenty-five times the\\naverage risk of developing oral cancer sometime during their lives due to\\nthe popularity of chewing tobacco in that country. In fact, India has the\\nworld’s highest incidence of oral cancer, with 75,000 to 80,000 new cases a\\nyear.

Normal body cells grow, divide, and die in an orderly way.\\nCancer cells, however, continue to grow and divide without dying. Instead,\\nthey outlive normal cells and continue to form new abnormal cancer cells.\\nAs most cancer cells continue to grow, they lump together and form an ex-\\ntra mass of tissue. This mass is called a malignant tumor.\\nAs a malignant tumor grows, it damages nearby tissue. Some cancers,\\nlike leukemia, do not form tumors. Instead, these cancer cells involve the\\nblood and blood-forming organs and circulate through other tissues, where\\nthey grow.\\nCancer can begin in one part of the body and spread to others. The\\nspread of a tumor to a new site is called metastasis. This process occurs as\\ncancer cells break away from a tumor and travel through the bloodstream or\\nthe lymph system to other areas of the body.

Most cancers result from perma-\\nnent damage to genes or from mutations, which occur either due to inter-\\nnal factors, such as hormones, immune conditions, metabolism, and the\\ndigestion of nutrients within cells, or by exposure to environmental or ex-\\nternal factors. A chemical or other environmental agent that produces can-\\ncer is called a carcinogen.\\nOverall, environmental factors, defined broadly to include tobacco use,\\ndiet, infectious diseases, chemicals, and radiation, are believed to cause be-\\ntween 75 and 80 percent of all cancer cases in the United States. Tobacco\\nuse, including cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff, can cause can-\\ncers of the lung, mouth, throat, larynx, bladder, kidney, esophagus, and pan-\\ncreas. Smoking alone causes one-third of all cancer deaths in the United\\nStates. Heavy consumption of alcohol has also been shown to increase the\\nrisk of developing cancer of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, liver,\\nand breast.\\nOverweight and obesity are associated with increased risk of cancers\\nof the breast, colon, endometrium, esophagus, kidney, and gallbladder. The\\nfollowing chemicals have been found to cause cancer: coal tars and their de-\\nrivatives, such as benzene; some hydrocarbons; aniline, a substance used to\\nmake dyes; and asbestos.

Other genes have been dis-\\ncovered that are associated with some cancers that run in families, such as\\ncancers of the colon, rectum, kidney, ovary, esophagus, lymph nodes, skin\\nmelanoma, and pancreas.\\nCarcinogenesis Process\\nAll cancers involve the malfunction of genes that control cell growth and\\ndivision. The process by which cancers develop is called carcinogenesis. This\\nprocess usually starts when chemicals or radiation damage DNA, the ge-\\nnetic structure inside cells. Viruses induce carcinogenesis by introducing\\nnew DNA sequences. Most of the time, when DNA becomes damaged the\\nbody is able to repair it. In cancer cells, however, the damaged DNA is\\nnot repaired. While normal cells with damaged DNA die, cancer cells with\\ndamaged DNA continue to multiply.\\nThere is a long time lag between exposure to a carcinogen and the oc-\\ncurrence of cancer. While cellular mutations cause cancer to develop, it is\\nnot exactly clear how this happens. Carcinogenesis is a multistep process,\\nin which as many as ten distinct mutations may have to accumulate in a cell\\nbefore it becomes cancerous.

For example, populations whose diet includes at least\\nfive servings of fruits and vegetables a day have lower rates of some of the\\nmost common cancers. Fruits and vegetables contain many antioxidants\\nand phytochemicals, such as vitamins A, C, and E, and beta-carotene, which\\nhave been shown to prevent cancer. It is not completely clear, however,\\nwhether it is individual phytochemicals, or a combination of them, or the\\nfiberin fruits and vegetables that result in reduced risk of cancer.\\nStudies have shown the risk of prostate cancer drops for men who eat\\ntomato products, possibly because of the phytochemical lycopene. In addi-\\ntion, it has been shown that colon cancer declines among those who drink\\ngreen tea, which contains antioxidants and phytochemicals, and who regu-\\nlarly eat soy products and foods rich in selenium, an antioxidant.\\nThose who eat a diet low in fat, especially animal fat, also have lower\\ncancer rates, but again it is not clear whether it is the calories, the amount\\nand distribution of body fat, or the likelihood that a low-fat diet is high in\\nfiber, fruits, and vegetables that is protective against cancer.

For colon cancer, physical activity\\naccelerates the movement of food through the intestine, thereby reducing\\nthe length of time that the bowel lining is exposed to potential carcinogens.\\nFor breast cancer, vigorous physical activity may decrease the exposure of\\nbreast tissue to circulating estrogen, a hormone that has been implicated\\nin breast cancer. Physical activity may also affect cancers of the colon, breast,\\nand other sites by improving energy metabolism and reducing circulating\\nconcentrations of insulin and related growth factors.\\nBecause of these factors, recommendations of the American Cancer So-\\nciety to reduce the risk of cancer include: consumption of a mostly plant-\\nbased diet, including five or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day;\\nconsumption of whole grains in preference to processed or refined grains\\nand sugar; limited consumption of high-fat foods, particularly from animal\\nsources; physical activity; and limited consumption of alcohol.\\nNutrition for People with Cancer\\nPeople with cancer often have increased nutritional needs. As such, it is im-\\nportant for them to consume a variety of foods that provide the nutrients\\nneeded to maintain health while fighting cancer. These nutrients include:\\nprotein, carbohydrates, fat, water, vitamins, and minerals. Nutrition sug-\\ngestions for people with cancer often emphasize eating high-calorie, high-\\nprotein foods. Protein helps to ensure growth, repair body tissue, and\\nmaintain a healthy immune system. Therefore, people with cancer often\\nneed more protein than usual.\\nGreat progress has been made in the fight against cancer, and cancer\\ndetection and treatments have improved significantly. However, there is a\\ndisparity in cancer death rates between developed and developing countries.\\nBetween 80 and 90 percent of cancer patients in developing countries have\\nlate-stage and often incurable cancer at the time of diagnosis.\\nA growing body of evidence shows that simple changes in diet and\\nlifestyle can help prevent many cancers. Further research into the exact\\nmechanisms by which certain diets may help prevent cancer is ongoing. SEE\\nALSO Antioxidants; Functional Foods; Phytochemicals.\\nGita C.

The chemical compounds\\nin carbohydrates are found in both simple and complex forms, and in order\\nfor the body to use carbohydrates for energy, food must undergo digestion,\\nabsorption, and glycolysis. It is recommended that 55 to 60 percent of\\ncaloric intake come from carbohydrates.\\nChemical Structure\\nCarbohydrates are a main source of energy for the body and are made of\\ncarbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Chlorophyll in plants absorbs light energy\\nfrom the sun. This energy is used in the process of photosynthesis, which\\nallows green plants to take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen and allows\\nfor the production of carbohydrates. This process converts the sun’s light\\nenergy into a form of chemical energy useful to humans. Plants transform\\ncarbon dioxide (CO2) from the air, water (H 2O) from the ground, and en-\\nergy from the sun into oxygen (O 2) and carbohydrates (C 6H12O6) (6 CO 2\\n+ 6 H 2O + energy = C 6H12O6 + 6 O 2). Most carbohydrates have a ratio of\\n1:2:1 of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, respectively.\\nHumans and other animals obtain carbohydrates by eating foods that\\ncontain them. In order to use the energy contained in the carbohydrates,\\nhumans must metabolize, or break down, the structure of the molecule in\\na process that is opposite that of photosynthesis. It starts with the carbohy-\\ndrate and oxygen and produces carbon dioxide, water, and energy. The body\\nutilizes the energy and water and rids itself of the carbon dioxide.\\nSimple Carbohydrates\\nSimple carbohydrates, or simple sugars, are composed of monosaccharide or\\ndisaccharide units. Common monosaccharides (carbohydrates composed of\\nsingle sugar units) include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Glucose is the\\nmost common type of sugar and the primary form of sugar that is stored in\\nthe body for energy. It sometimes is referred to as blood sugar or dextrose\\nand is of particular importance to individuals who have diabetes or hypo-\\nglycemia. Fructose, the primary sugar found in fruits, also is found in honey\\nand high-fructose corn syrup (in soft drinks) and is a major source of sugar\\nin the dietof Americans. Galactose is less likely than glucose or fructose to\\nbe found in nature. Instead, it often combines with glucose to form the dis-\\naccharide lactose, often referred to as milk sugar. Both fructose and galac-\\ntose are metabolized to glucose for use by the body.\\nOligosaccharides are carbohydrates made of two to ten monosaccharides.\\nThose composed of two sugars are specifically referred to as disaccharides,\\nor double sugars. They contain two monosaccharides bound by either an\\nalpha bond or a beta bond. Alpha bonds are digestible by the human body,\\nwhereas beta bonds are more difficult for the body to break down.\\nThere are three particularly important disaccharides: sucrose, maltose,\\nand lactose. Sucrose is formed when glucose and fructose are held together\\nby an alpha bond. It is found in sugar cane or sugar beets and is refined to\\nmake granulated table sugar.

Maltose, or malt sugar, is composed of two glucose units linked by\\nan alpha bond. It is produced from the chemical decomposition of starch,\\nwhich occurs during the germination of seeds and the production of alco-\\nhol. Lactose is a combination of glucose and galactose. Because it contains\\na beta bond, it is hard for some individuals to digest in large quantities. Ef-\\nfective digestion requires sufficient amounts of the enzyme lactase.\\nComplex Carbohydrates\\nComplex carbohydrates, or polysaccharides, are composed of simple sugar\\nunits in long chains called polymers. Three polysaccharides are of particu-\\nlar importance in human nutrition: starch, glycogen, and dietary fiber.\\nStarch and glycogen are digestible forms of complex carbohydrates made\\nof strands of glucose units linked by alpha bonds. Starch, often contained\\nin seeds, is the form in which plants store energy, and there are two types:\\namylose and amylopectin. Starch represents the main type of digestible com-\\nplex carbohydrate. Humans use an enzyme to break down the bonds link-\\ning glucose units, thereby releasing the sugar to be absorbed into the\\nbloodstream. At that point, the body can distribute glucose to areas that\\nneed energy, or it can store the glucose in the form of glycogen.\\nGlycogen is the polysaccharide used to store energy in animals, includ-\\ning humans. Like starch, glycogen is made up of chains of glucose linked\\nby alpha bonds; but glycogen chains are more highly branched than starch.\\nIt is this highly branched structure that allows the bonds to be more quickly\\nbroken down by enzymes in the body. The primary storage sites for glyco-\\ngen in the human body are the liver and the muscles.\\nAnother type of complex carbohydrate is dietary fiber. In general, di-\\netary fiber is considered to be polysaccharides that have not been digested\\nat the point of entry into the large intestine. Fiber contains sugars linked\\nby bonds that cannot be broken down by human enzymes, and are there-\\n94\\nCarbohydrates\\nSUGAR COMPARISON\\nMonosaccharide or Additional\\nSugar Carbohydrate disaccharide information\\nBeet sugar (cane sugar) Sucrose Disaccharide Similar to white and powdered sugar, but\\n(fructose and glucose) varied degree of purification \\nBrown sugar Sucrose Disaccharide Similar to white and powdered sugar, but\\n(fructose and glucose) varied degree of purification  \\nCorn syrup Glucose Monosaccharide\\nFruit sugar Fructose Monosaccharide Very sweet\\nHigh-fructose corn syrup  Fructose Monosaccharide Very sweet and inexpensive\\nAdded to soft drinks and canned or\\nfrozen fruits\\nHoney Fructose and glucose Monosaccharides\\nMalt sugar Maltose Disaccharide Formed by the hydrolysis of starch, but\\n(glucose and glucose) sweeter than starch  \\nMaple syrup Sucrose Disaccharide\\n(fructose and glucose)\\nMilk sugar Lactose Disaccharide Made in mammary glands of most\\n(glucose and galactose) lactating animals \\nPowdered sugar Sucrose Disaccharide Similar to white and brown sugar, but\\n(fructose and glucose) varied degree of purification \\nWhite sugar Sucrose Disaccharide Similar to brown and powdered sugar,\\n(fructose and glucose) but varied degree of purification\\nSOURCE: Mahan and Escott-Stump, 2000; Northwestern University; Sizer and Whitney, 1997; and Wardlaw and Kessel, 2002.\\nenzyme: protein responsible for carrying\\nout reactions in a cell\\nnutrition: the maintenance of health\\nthrough proper eating, or the study of\\nsame\\nglycogen: storage form of sugar\\nfiber: indigestible plant material that aids\\ndigestion by providing bulk'),\n",

Mu-\\ncilages are dietary fibers that contain galactose, manose, and other mono-\\nsaccharides; and gums are dietary fibers that contain galactose, glucuronic\\nacid, and other monosaccharides. Sources of gums include oats, legumes,\\nguar, and barley.\\nDigestion and Absorption\\nCarbohydrates must be digested and absorbed in order to transform them\\ninto energy that can be used by the body. Food preparation often aids in\\nthe digestion process. When starches are heated, they swell and become eas-\\nier for the body to break down. In the mouth, the enzyme amylase, which\\nis contained in saliva, mixes with food products and breaks some starches\\ninto smaller units. However, once the carbohydrates reach the acidic envi-\\nronment of the stomach, the amylase is inactivated. After the carbohydrates\\nhave passed through the stomach and into the small intestine, key digestive\\nenzymes are secreted from the pancreas and the small intestine where most\\ndigestion and absorption occurs. Pancreatic amylase breaks starch into di-\\nsaccharides and small polysaccharides, and enzymes from the cells of the\\nsmall-intestinal wall break any remaining disaccharides into their monosac-\\ncharide components. Dietary fiber is not digested by the small intestine; in-\\nstead, it passes to the colon unchanged.\\nSugars such as galactose, glucose, and fructose that are found natu-\\nrally in foods or are produced by the breakdown of polysaccharides enter\\ninto absorptive intestinal cells. After absorption, they are transported to\\nthe liver where galactose and fructose are converted to glucose and re-\\nleased into the bloodstream. The glucose may be sent directly to organs\\nthat need energy, it may be transformed into glycogen (in a process called\\nglycogenesis) for storage in the liver or muscles, or it may be converted\\nto and stored as fat.\\nGlycolysis\\nThe molecular bonds in food products do not yield high amounts of energy\\nwhen broken down. Therefore, the energy contained in food is released\\nwithin cells and stored in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a high-\\nenergy compound created by cellular energy-production systems. Carbohy-\\ndrates are metabolized and used to produce ATP molecules through a\\nprocess called glycolysis.\\nGlycolysis breaks down glucose or glycogen into pyruvic acid through\\nenzymatic reactions within the cytoplasm of the cells. The process results\\nin the formation of three molecules of ATP (two, if the starting product was\\nglucose). Without the presence of oxygen, pyruvic acid is changed to lac-\\ntic acid, and the energy-production process ends. However, in the presence\\nof oxygen, larger amounts of ATP can be produced. In that situation, pyru-\\nvic acid is transformed into a chemical compound called acetyle coenzyme A,\\na compound that begins a complex series of reactions in the Krebs Cycle\\nand the electron transport system. The end result is a net gain of up to\\nthirty-nine molecules of ATP from one molecule of glycogen (thirty-eight\\n96\\nCarbohydrates\\nlegumes: beans, peas, and related plants\\nenzymatic: related to use of enzymes,\\nproteins that cause chemical reactions to\\noccur\\ncytoplasm: contents of a cell minus the\\nnucleus\\nlactic acid:breakdown product of sugar\\nin the muscles in the absence of oxygen\\nKrebs Cycle: cellular reaction that breaks\\ndown numerous nutrients and provides\\nbuilding blocks for other molecules'),\n",

Thus, through certain systems, glu-\\ncose can be used very efficiently in the production of energy for the body.\\nRecommended Intake\\nAt times, carbohydrates have been incorrectly labeled as “fattening.” Evi-\\ndence actually supports the consumption of more, rather than less, starchy\\nfoods. Carbohydrates have four calories per gram, while dietary fats con-\\ntribute nine per gram, so diets high in complex carbohydrates are likely to\\nprovide fewer calories than diets high in fat. Recommendations are for 55\\nto 60 percent of total calories to come from carbohydrates (approximately\\n275 to 300 grams for a 2,000-calorie diet). The majority of carbohydrate\\ncalories should come from complex rather than simple carbohydrates. Of\\ntotal caloric intake, approximately 45 to 50 percent of calories should be\\nfrom complex carbohydrates, and 10 percent or less from simple carbohy-\\ndrates.\\nIt is important to consume a minimum amount of carbohydrates to pre-\\nvent ketosis, a condition resulting from the breakdown of fat for energy in\\nthe absence of carbohydrates. In this situation, products of fat breakdown,\\ncalled ketone bodies, build up in the blood and alter normal pH balance.\\nThis can be particularly harmful to a fetus. To avoid ketosis, daily carbo-\\nhydrate intake should include a minimum of 50 to 100 grams. In terms of\\ndietary fiber, a minimum intake of 20 to 35 grams per day is recommended.\\n97\\nCarbohydrates\\nLow-Carb Diets\\nLow-carbohydrate diets, such as the Atkins\\nand South Beach diets, are based on the\\nproposition that it’s not fat that makes you fat.\\nAllowing dieters to eat steak, butter, eggs, ba-\\ncon, and other high-fat foods, these diets in-\\nstead outlaw starches and refined\\ncarbohydrates on the theory that they are me-\\ntabolized so quickly that they lead to hunger\\nand overeating. This theory, which was first\\npopularized in the nineteenth century, came\\nunder scathing criticism from the medical es-\\ntablishment during the early 1970s when Dr.\\nRobert Atkins published the phenomenally\\npopular low-carb diet bearing his name. Ac-\\ncording to the American Medical Association\\n(AMA), the Atkins diet was a “bizarre regimen”\\nthat advocated “an unlimited intake of satu-\\nrated fats and cholesterol-rich foods” and\\ntherefore presented a considerable risk of\\nheart disease. Most doctors recommended in-\\nstead a diet low in fat and high in carbohy-\\ndrates, with plenty of grains, fruits, and\\nvegetables and limited red meat or dairy prod-\\nucts. This became the received wisdom during\\nthe 1980s, at the same time that the U.S.\\nwaistline began to expand precipitously. As di-\\neters found that weight loss was difficult to\\nmaintain on a low-fat diet, low-carb diets re-\\ngained popularity—with as many as 30 million\\npeople trying a low-carb diet in 2003. Several\\nsmall-scale studies began to suggest that a\\nlow-carb diet may indeed be effective and may\\nnot have the deleterious effects its detractors\\nhave claimed; other research found that any\\nbenefits of a low-carb diet are short-lived, and\\nthat the negative effects will take decades to\\nbecome evident. The National Institutes of\\nHealth has pledged $2.5 million for a five-year\\nstudy of the Atkins diet with 360 subjects.\\nWhile the results of this and other large-scale\\nstudies are awaited, many researchers stress\\nthat the key issue in maintaining a healthy\\nweight is the number of calories consumed,\\nnot the type of calories. The National Acad-\\nemy of Sciences recommends that adults ob-\\ntain 45 to 65 percent of their calories from\\ncarbohydrates, 20 to 35 percent from fat, and\\n10 to 35 percent from protein.\\n—Paula Kepos\\ncalorie: unit of food energy\\nketosis: build-up of ketone bodies in the\\nblood, due to fat breakdown\\npH: level of acidity, with low numbers in-\\ndicating high acidity'),\n",

The heart works on electrical impulses and produces them con-\\nstantly, unless stress, fear, or danger is involved, in which case the impulses\\nwill increase dramatically. The body’s largest artery is the aorta and the\\nlargest vein is the vena cava. Veins are thinner than arteries, which resem-\\nble rubber bands in that they expand more easily (depending on the amount\\nof blood passing through them). Smaller blood vessels, or capillaries, chan-\\nnel oxygen and blood to tissues. The process is a cycle in which the capil-\\nlaries deliver oxygen-rich blood to the body and pick up oxygen-poor blood,\\nwhich is then taken into the veins and finally to the heart to be “rejuve-\\nnated” or cleansed.\\nCardiovascular disease (CVD), and the resulting complications, is the\\nmain cause of death for both males and females in the United States and\\nother technologically advanced countries of the world. It usually is in the\\ntop five causes of death in lesser-developed countries. Diseases of the car-\\ndiovascular system include those that compromise the pumping ability of\\nthe heart, cause failure of the valves, or result in narrowing or hardening of\\nthe arteries. In addition, toxins and infectious agents may damage the heart\\nand blood vessels. Injury or failure of the cardiovascular system, especially\\nthe heart, also will affect the peripheral tissues that depend on the delivery\\nof nutrients and the removal of wastes through the blood vascular system.\\nCVD is a family of diseases that includes hypertension, atherosclerosis,\\ncoronary heart disease, and stroke.\\nHypertension (High Blood Pressure)\\nBlood pressure is a measure of the force of blood against the walls of ar-\\nteries. It is recorded as two numbers: the systolic pressure over the diastolic\\npressure. Systolic pressure is the pressure as the heart beats, while diastolic\\npressure measures the pressure when the heart relaxes between beats.\\nBlood pressure is normally measured at the brachial artery with a sphyg-\\nmomanometer (pressure cuff) in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and given\\nas systolic over diastolic pressure. Normal blood pressure is less than 120\\nmm Hg systolic and less than 80 mm Hg diastolic—usually expressed as “120\\nover 80.” However, normal for an individual varies with the height, weight,\\nfitness level, age, and health of a person. Blood pressure is normally main-\\ntained within narrow limits, but it can drop during sleep or increase during\\nexercise. Hypertension (HTN), or high blood pressure, occurs when the force\\nof blood passing through blood vessels is above normal. The increase in pres-\\nsure forces the blood to hit the blood vessel walls. HTN is called “the silent\\nkiller” because many people do not know they have the condition. Consis-\\ntently high blood pressure increases the risk for a stroke or a heart attack.\\n99\\nCardiovascular Disease\\ncardiovascular: related to the heart and\\ncirculatory system\\nartery:blood vessel that carries blood away\\nfrom the heart toward the body tissues\\nstress:heightened state of nervousness\\nor unease\\noxygen: O2, atmospheric gas required\\nby all animals\\ntoxins: poison\\nnutrient: dietary substance necessary\\nfor health\\nhypertension: high blood pressure\\natherosclerosis: build-up of deposits\\nwithin the blood vessels\\ncoronary heart disease:disease of the\\ncoronary arteries, the blood vessels sur-\\nrounding the heart\\nstroke: loss of blood supply to part of\\nthe brain, due to a blocked or burst\\nartery in the brain\\nblood pressure: measure of the pressure\\nexerted by the blood against the walls of\\nthe blood vessels\\nheart attack: loss of blood supply to part\\nof the heart, resulting in death of heart\\nmuscle'),\n",

Other approaches to controlling HTN include weight loss, smoking\\ncessation, increased physical activity, and stress management.\\nAtherosclerosis\\nAtherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, is the cause of more than half\\nof all mortality in developed countries and the leading cause of death in the\\nUnited States. When the coronary arteries are involved, it results in coro-\\nnary artery disease (CAD). The hardening of the arteries is due to the build\\nup of fatty deposits called plaque, and mineral deposits. As a result, the sup-\\nply of blood to the heart muscle (myocardium) is reduced and can lead to\\nischema (deficiency of blood) to the heart, causing chest pain or a myocar-\\ndial infarction (heart attack). The hardening of the arteries causes an in-\\ncrease in resistance to blood flow, and therefore an increase in blood\\npressure. Any vessel in the body may be affected by atherosclerosis; how-\\never, the aorta and the coronary, carotid, and iliac arteries are most fre-\\nquently affected. The process begins early in life. Therefore, physicians\\nshould obtain risk-factor profiles and a family history for children.\\nCoronary Artery Disease\\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) refers to any of the conditions that affect the\\ncoronary arteries and reduces blood flow and nutrients to the heart. It is the\\nleading cause of death worldwide for both men and women. Atherosclerosis\\nis the primary cause of CAD. Controlled risk factors associated with CAD\\ninclude hypertension, cigarette smoking, elevated blood lipids (e.g., choles-\\nterol, triglyceride), a high-fat diet (especially saturated fats and trans-fatty\\nacids), physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes, and stress. Lifestyle changes can\\nassist in prevention of CAD. Uncontrolled risk factors include a family his-\\ntory of CAD, gender (higher in males), and increasing age.\\nStroke\\nStroke, or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), occurs when the brain does\\nnot receive sufficient oxygen-rich blood through blood vessels or when a\\nblood vessel bursts. A stroke may result from blockage of the blood vessels\\ndue to a blood clot (ischemic) or from ruptures of the blood vessels (hem-\\norrhagic bursts). Uncontrolled hypertension is a major risk factor for strokes.\\nPreventing CVD\\nThe symptoms of CVD develop over many years and often do not manifest\\nthemselves until old age. Autopsies of young servicemen indicate significant\\naccumulation of plaque and hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Thus,\\nprimary prevention for CVD must begin in early childhood. Preventing pre-\\nmature CVD (before age 60) is crucial. Heart attacks between the ages of\\nforty and sixty are primarily due to lifestyle factors.\\nSmoking, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and lack of phys-\\nical activity are the most serious risk factors for CVD and heart attack. Con-\\ntrolling one of these risk factors can help control others. For example, regular\\n100\\nCardiovascular Disease\\ndiet: the total daily food intake, or the\\ntypes of foods eaten\\nobesity: the condition of being over-\\nweight, according to established norms\\nbased on sex, age, and height\\nplaque: material forming deposits on the\\nsurface of the teeth, which may promote\\nbacterial growth and decay\\nlipid: fats, waxes and steroids; important\\ncomponents of cell membranes\\ncholesterol:multi-ringed molecule found\\nin animal cell membranes; a type of lipid\\ntriglyceride: a type of fat\\ntrans-fatty acids: type of fat thought to\\nincrease the risk of heart disease\\ndiabetes:inability to regulate level of\\nsugar in the blood\\nThe sphygmomanometer around this\\nwoman’s arm is inflated until it collapses\\nher brachial artery, and then gradually\\ndeflated.

Indeed, the beauty, warmth, and lush\\nlandscapes had Christopher Columbus in awe in 1492 when he came upon\\nthese tropical islands, stretching approximately 2,600 miles between Florida\\nand Venezuela.\\nEuropean Settlement\\nThe Arawaks and Caribs, the first natives of the islands, were not treated\\nkindly, however, as the Spanish, French, Dutch, and British conquered the\\nislands at different periods, all but wiping out the native populations. To-\\nday, only a few aboriginals remain in the Caribbean.\\nThe European settlers soon realized that sugarcane was a profitable crop\\nthat could be exported to the European market. However, there was a short-\\nage of European farmers, and slaves were brought from Africa to work on\\nthe sugar plantations. The slave trade started in 1698. European settlers\\nfought to keep their territories and hoped for great wealth, while actively\\npursuing the sugar and slave trades.\\nTwo things changed the situation on the islands. In 1756, missionaries\\nfrom Germany (Moravian Protestants), came to the islands, though the\\nlandowners were opposed to their presence, fearing that any education of\\nthe slaves could lead to a revolution. At about the same time a German sci-\\nentist by the name of Margraf discovered that sugar could be produced from\\nbeets, and many European countries began to produce their own sugar.\\nIn 1772, after many revolts and uprisings, the Europeans began to free\\ntheir slaves. The sugar plantations still needed laborers, however, and inden-\\ntured workers were brought from China and India to work in the fields. Sugar\\ncane, and its by-products, molasses and rum, brought great prosperity to the\\nsettlers.

Foods of Creole, Chinese, African, Indian, Hispanic, and European\\norigin blend harmoniously to produce mouth-watering dishes.\\nFruits and Vegetables. There are many fruits and vegetables found in\\nthe various Caribbean Islands, and because many of them have been ex-\\nported to North America and Europe, people have become familiar with\\nthem. This exotic array of fruits and vegetables in vibrant colors forms the\\nheart of island cooking.\\nChayote, also called Christophene or Cho-cho, is a firm pear-shaped\\nsquash used in soups and stews. The Chinese vegetable bokchoy (or pakchoy)\\nhas become widely used on the islands. Plantains, which resemble bananas,\\nare roasted, sautéed, fried, and added to stews and soups. The breadfruit grows\\nprofusely, and is either boiled or baked, sliced, and eaten hot, or ground into\\nflour. The breadfruit blossoms make a very good preserve.\\nYucca, also known as cassava or manioc, is a slender tuber with bark-like\\nskin and a very starchy flesh that must be cooked and served like a potato, or\\nit can be made into cassava bread.

The food of the Caribbean can be highly\\nspiced. The Scotch bonnet, a colorful pepper with a hot aroma, is widely\\nused in soups, salads, sauces, and marinades. Some other important spices\\nare annatto, curry, pimento, cinnamon, and ginger. Annatto seeds are often\\nsteeped in oil and used to flavor soups, stews, and fish dishes. Curry pow-\\nder is made from a variety of freshly grounded spices. Curry dishes and hot\\nsauces, which are used regularly in cooking, were brought to the islands by\\nIndian settlers.\\nPimento, also known as allspice, is used in pickles, marinades, soups,\\nand stews and is an important ingredient in jerking, a method of cooking\\nmeat and poultry over an open fire.

The spices and the method of slow cooking over a fire\\ngive jerk meat its distinctive flavor.\\nProtein Sources. Although fish, conch (a pink shellfish), goat meat, pork,\\nand beef are used throughout the Caribbean, legumes make up a fair per-\\ncentage of the region’s protein intake. Kidney and lima beans, chickpeas,\\nlentils, black-eyed peas, and other legumes are used in soups, stews, and rice\\ndishes. Accra fritters, made from soaked black-eyed peas that are mashed,\\nseasoned with pepper, and then fried, is a dish of West African origin sim-\\nilar to the Middle Eastern falafel. Sancocho is a hearty Caribbean stew made\\nwith vegetables, tubers, and meats.\\nCooking Methods. A “cook-up” dish is one made with whatever ingre-\\ndients an individual has on hand, and is an opportunity to be creative. Such\\na dish will often include rice, vegetables, and possibly meat. By adding co-\\nconut milk, this could turn into an enticing coconut-scented pilaf. Burning\\nsugar to color stews is another technique used in island cooking. This process\\nbegins by heating oil, then adding sugar, and stirring until the sugar be-\\ncomes an amber color.\\nThe roti is a griddle-baked flour wrapping that is filled with curried\\nmeat, chicken, or potatoes. Coucou, or fungi, is a cornmeal mush that is\\nserved with meat, poultry, fish, or vegetable dishes.\\nBeverages and Desserts. A variety of fruit beverages are often served\\nin the Caribbean. Beverages include green tea and “bush tea,” served sweet-\\nened with sugar or honey, with or without milk. Bush tea is an infusion\\nof tropical shrubs, grasses, and leaves that has a number of medicinal uses.\\nPeople drink it as a remedy for gas, the common cold, asthma, high blood\\npressure, fever, and other ailments.

They were able to increase the protein and\\ncalorieneeds by making meat, fats, oils, and refined sugar more avail-\\nable. The health and nutrition initiatives introduced helped curbed the\\nmalnutrition, but new and related health and nutrition problems began\\nto emerge.\\n110\\nCaribbean Islanders, Diet of\\nPOPULAR DISHES OF SELECTED CARIBBEAN ISLANDS\\nIsland Special dishes\\nAntigua, Montserrat, Nevis Fish soup, pepper pot soup (any available fish,\\nmeat, chicken, and vegetables cooked in fermented\\ncassava juice); saltfish with avocado and eggplant\\nBarbados Flying fish; jug-jug (mashed stew of pigeon peas,\\nusually served at Christmas)\\nBlack pudding (a type of sausage made by\\ncombining cooked rice mixed with fresh pig’s\\nblood, seasoned with salt, pepper, and other\\ncondiments, and placed in thoroughly cleaned\\npieces of pig’s intestine, and then tied on both ends\\nand boiled in seasoned water)\\nBelize Rice and chicken, tamales, conch fritters, refried\\nbeans and iswa (fresh corn tortillas)\\nDominica Tannia (coco, a starch tuber soup); mountain\\nchicken (frog’s legs)\\nGrenada Callaloo (soup with green vegetables)\\nLambi souse (conch marinated in lime juice, hot\\npepper, onion); oil-down (a highly seasoned dish of\\ncoconut milk and salted fish)\\nGuyana Mellagee (one-pot stew of pickled meat/fish and\\ncoconut milk with tubers and vegetables); rice treat\\n(rice with shrimp, vegetables, and pineapple)\\nJamaica Saltfish and ackee (a fruit commonly used as a\\nvegetable, boiled and then sautéed in oil);\\nescoveitched fish (fried fish marinated in vinegar\\nspices, seasoning); roasted breadfruit; asham or\\nbrown George (parched dried corn that is finely\\nbeaten in a mortar, sifted, and mixed with sugar)\\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines Stewed shark\\nBritish Virgin Islands Fish chowder, conch salad, saltfish and rice\\nTrinidad and Tobago Pelau (rice with meat, fish, peas, vegetables);\\npakoras; kachouri; palouri (fried vegetable fritters)\\nGuadeloupe and Martinique Mechoui (spit-roasted sheep); pate en pot (finely\\nchopped sheep and lamb parts cooked into a thick,\\nhighly seasoned stew)\\nchronic: over a long period\\nmalnutrition: chronic lack of sufficient\\nnutrients to maintain health\\ncalorie: unit of food energy'),\n",

The basis of the traditional diet in this part of the\\nworld is corn (maize) and beans, with the addition of meat, animal prod-\\nucts, local fruits, and vegetables. As in other parts of the world, the diet of\\npeople in this area has expanded to include more processed foods. In many\\nparts of Mexico and Central America, access to a variety of foods remains\\nlimited, and undernutrition, particularly among children, is a major prob-\\nlem. Although access to an increased variety of foods can improve the ade-\\nquacy of both macronutrient and micronutrient status, there is evidence\\nthat the use of processed foods is contributing to the rapidly increasing\\nprevalenceof obesity and diet-related chronic diseases such as diabetes.\\nTraditional Dietary Habits\\nThe central staple in the region is maize, which is generally ground and\\ntreated with lime and then pressed into flat cakes called tortillas. In Mexico\\nand Guatemala, these are flat and thin, while in other Central American\\ncountries tortillas are thicker. In El Salvador, for example, small, thick cakes\\nof maize, filled with meat, cheese, or beans, are called pupusas. Maize is also\\nused in a variety of other preparations, including tacos, tamales, and a thin\\ngruel called atole. The complementary staple in the region is beans (frijoles),\\nmost commonly black or pinto beans.

Best known\\namong these are the chile peppers, tomatoes, and tomatillos that are used\\nin the salsas of Mexico. Avocado is also very popular in Mexican and Cen-\\ntral American cuisines.

Salvadorian pupusas are toasted tortillas filled with cheese,\\nbeans, or pork rind eaten with coleslaw and a special hot sauce.\\nCentral American and Mexican Dishes\\nBeyond the basic staples, the cuisine of Mexico and Central America is rich\\nwith many regional variations. The tortilla-based Mexican preparations fa-\\nmiliar in the United States are generally simpler in form in Mexico. Tacos\\nare generally made with meat, chicken, or fish grilled or fried with season-\\ning and served on tortillas; enchiladas are filled tortillas dipped in a chile-\\nbased sauce and fried; and tostadas are fried tortillas topped with refried beans\\nor meat, and sometimes with vegetables and cream. Chiles rellenos are made\\nwith the large and sweet chile poblano and filled with ground meat. Exam-\\nples of specialty dishes include mole, a sauce made with chocolate, chile, and\\nspices and served over chicken, beef, or enchiladas; and ceviche, raw mari-\\nnated fish or seafood made along the coast throughout Central America and\\nMexico.\\nNutritional Benefits\\nThe staple diet of the region—corn and beans, supplemented with meat,\\ndairy products, and local fruit and vegetables—is nutritionally complete and\\nwell suited to a healthful lifestyle. The proper combination of tortilla and\\nbeans provides an excellent complement of amino acids, thus supplying the\\nnecessary amount of complex protein. The process of liming the maize\\nmakes the calcium and the niacin in the tortilla more bioavailable, and this\\nfood is a major source of these nutrients. In addition, the traditional prepa-\\nration of tortillas with a hand mill and grinding stones appears to add iron\\nand zinc to the tortilla. Beans are excellent sources of B vitamins, magne-\\nsium, folate, and fiber. The tomato and chile-based salsas, along with sev-\\neral of the tropical fruits such as limes and oranges are important sources\\nof vitamin C, and the variety of vegetables and yellow fruits such as papaya,\\nmelon, and mango provide excellent sources of carotenoids, which are pre-\\ncursors of vitamin A.\\nNutritional Limitations\\nUnfortunately, limited financial access to this variety of foods for many peo-\\nple in Central America and Mexico means that the diet often does not in-\\nclude sufficient levels of vitamins and minerals.

When animal products are included, there\\nhas been a tendency to choose high-fat products such as sausage and fried\\npork rinds (chicharron). The use of lard and a preference for fried foods also\\ncontributes to high intakes of saturated fat and cholesterol among subsets\\nof the population.\\nInfluence of Central American and Mexican Culture\\nAs two cultures intermingle, foods and preparations from each tend to in-\\nfiltrate the other. This is clearly the case near the U.S.-Mexican border,\\nwhere Mexican immigrants and return immigrants have incorporated foods\\nfrom U.S. diets into their traditional diets. The result has been a modified\\nform of Mexican cuisine popularly known as “Tex-Mex.” Beyond the border,\\nthis Americanized version of popular Mexican foods has spread through-\\nout the United States through the popularity of Mexican restaurants. In the\\nUnited States, tacos and tostadas tend to have less Mexican seasoning, but\\ninclude lettuce and shredded processed cheese. Flour, rather than corn, tor-\\ntillas are more widely used along the border. Many foods, such as soups and\\nchiles, prepared along the border have become known for their spicy hot-\\nness, due to the Mexican-influenced use of chiles and chile powder.\\nChanges in Dietary Practices\\nThroughout the world, the diets of traditional cultures have experienced\\nwhat has been called the “nutrition transition,” particularly during the last\\nfew decades of the twentieth century. In Mexico and Central America, as\\nelsewhere, this transition has been fueled by globalization and urbaniza-\\ntion. Major dietary changes include an increased use of animal products and\\nprocessed foods that include large amounts of sugar, refined flour, and hy-\\ndrogenated fats. At the same time, a decline in the intake of whole grains,\\nfruit, and vegetables has been documented. While the increased variety has\\nimproved micronutrient status for many low-income groups, the inclusion\\nof more animal fat and refined foods has contributed to a rapid increase in\\nobesity and chronic disease throughout the region.\\nThese changes are more evident among immigrants to the United States,\\nwhere adoption of U.S. products has been shown to have both positive and\\nnegative impacts on nutritional status. Studies that compared diets of Mexi-\\ncan residents to newly arrived Mexican-American immigrants and to second-\\ngeneration Mexican Americans have documented both nutritionally positive\\nand negative changes with acculturation. On the positive side, acculturated\\nMexican Americans consume less lard and somewhat more fruit, vegetables,\\nand milk than either newly arrived immigrants or Mexican residents. On the\\nnegative side, they also consume less tortilla, beans, soups, stews, gruels, and\\nfruit-based drinks, with greater use of meat, sweetened ready-to-eat breakfast\\ncereals, soft drinks, candy, cakes, ice cream, snack chips, and salad dressings.\\nConclusion\\nThe traditional diet of Mexico and Central America is based on corn and\\nbeans, but offers a wide diversity of preparations. Coupled with locally avail-\\nable fruits, vegetables, meat and dairy products, the diet can be highly nutri-\\ntious.

The amount of various foods, especially foods of animal origin, was al-\\nmost always insufficient in the USSR and the majority of its satellite\\ncountries. Data on food consumption compiled by the Food and Agricul-\\ntural Organization (FAO) confirm that meat consumption was, between\\n1961 and 1990, substantially lower in the USSR, Poland, Romania, and Bul-\\ngaria than in Western Europe or the United States. Similarly, the con-\\nsumption of milk and butter in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania was\\nsignificantly lower in comparison with Western and Northern Europe.\\nThe increase of CVD mortality within the Soviet bloc seems to be only\\npartially associated with a high prevalence of traditional risk factors. Efforts\\nto apply the experience gained from successful preventive projects in Fin-\\nland or the United States without analyzing the specificity of risk factors in\\nthis region, could lead to an incorrect formulation of priorities when de-\\ntermining preventive measures. The contribution of physical activity re-\\nmains an open issue, but due to technical backwardness (lower number of\\ncars, lower mechanization, etc.), the physical activity of people working in\\nindustry, agriculture, and services was generally higher in Eastern Europe\\nthan in the West.\\n118\\nCentral Europeans and Russians, Diets of\\nheart disease: any disorder of the heart\\nor its blood supply, including heart attack,\\natherosclerosis, and coronary artery \\ndisease'),\n",

Historically, chubby babies\\nand toddlers were more likely to survive infections and contagious diseases,\\nand overweight children and family members were often signs of affluence\\nand financial security in a community. Thus, in some cultures, overweight\\nwas a valued body type.\\nToday, being overweight puts a child at risk of developing chronic dis-\\neases such as type II diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol levels.\\nObesity can promote degenerative joint disease, which will result in painful\\nknees, hips, feet, and back, and it can severely limit physical activity. These\\nare health concerns previously seen only in adults, usually in those over age\\nforty. Obesity can be measured using a tool called body mass index (BMI).\\nThe BMI of an individual can be derived from tables or calculated using a\\nformula (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). In the\\nyear 2000, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) re-\\nleased updated growth charts incorporating BMI percentiles for children,\\nbeginning with children two years of age and extending the curves to age\\ntwenty. Using these gender-specific graphs, children, adolescents, and young\\nadults are at risk for overweight at the 85th through 89.9th percentiles and\\nare classified as overweight at the 95th percentile or greater. Using this cri-\\nteria, children and teens are not labeled “obese”; technically, they are only\\n“at risk of overweight” or “overweight.” In much of the scientific literature,\\nhowever, the terms are used interchangeably.\\nNutritionists and researchers have been tracking data that clearly shows\\nan increasing trend of overweight children in the United States. Monitor-\\ning the proportion of overweight children was identified as one of the ten\\nleading health indicators in Healthy People 2010. All ethnic, racial, gender,\\nand age groups have shown increases. For example, in the 1963–1970 Na-\\ntional Health Examination Survey (NHES), the prevalence of overweight\\namong white six to eleven years old was 5.1 percent and 5.3 percent for\\nAfrican-American girls of the same age. The prevalence of overweight in\\nthis same age group doubled for white girls (10.2%) and tripled for African-\\nAmerican girls (16.2%) in the 1988–1991 National Health and Nutrition\\nExamination Survey (NHANES III). Preliminary data from 1999 NHANES\\nsuggests that the percentage of overweight children has continued to in-\\ncrease in recent years. It is estimated that 13 percent of children ages six to\\neleven years and 14 percent of adolescents ages twelve to nineteen years\\nare overweight. This represents a 2-3 percentage point increase from\\nNHANES III.\\nAfrican-American and Hispanic teens are more likely to be at risk or over-\\nweight than white or Asian adolescents. Combined data from nine large stud-\\nies (including NHANES II and NHANES III) of 66,772 children between\\nfive to seventeen years old indicates that the highest percentage of over-\\nweight exists among Hispanic boys and African-American and Hispanic girls.\\n121\\nChildhood Obesity\\noverweight: weight above the accepted\\nnorm based on height, sex, and age\\nchronic: over a long period\\ntype II diabetes: inability to regulate the\\nlevel of sugar in the blood due to a reduc-\\ntion in the number of insulin receptors on\\nthe body’s cells\\nhypertension: high blood pressure\\ncholesterol: multi-ringed molecule found\\nin animal cell membranes; a type of lipid\\nobesity:the condition of being over-\\nweight, according to established norms\\nbased on sex, age, and height\\nbody mass index: weight in kilograms\\ndivided by square of the height in meters;\\na measure of body fat\\nobese: above accepted standards of\\nweight for sex, height, and age\\nprevalence: describing the number of\\ncases in a population at any one time'),\n",

Second- and third-generation Asian-American\\nchildren are more likely to be overweight, and certain Asian-American and\\nPacific Islander groups (Pacific Islanders, Koreans, Asian Indians) are noted\\nto have higher overweight risks than other Asian Americans.\\nAccording to Dr. Mikael Fogelholm (at the May 2003 European Con-\\nference on Obesity), “the prevalence of obesity among adolescents world-\\nwide has increased more rapidly than in middle-age adults.” Outside the\\nUnited States, obesity rates range from 2 percent in some developing coun-\\ntries to as high as 80 percent on remote Pacific Islands. In the United States,\\none child in four is now classified as overweight or at risk for becoming\\noverweight. It is generally agreed that the longer and more overweight a\\nchild is, the more likely it is that the condition will continue into adulthood.\\nPredisposing factors are complex and include a mix of genetic, social, cul-\\ntural, environmental, and lifestyle factors.\\nStatistics show that a child with two obese parents has an 80 percent\\nrisk of becoming overweight, a child with only one obese parent has a 40\\npercent risk, and a child with normal weight parents has a 7 percent risk of\\nbecoming overweight. Twins who were adopted by different families were\\nfound to be more similar in weight to the biological parents than to their\\nadoptive parents. Although the exact cause is still unknown, prenatal factors\\nsuch as maternal obesity, excess pregnancy weight gain, and diabetes may\\nalso predispose a child to becoming overweight.\\nOther risk factors include meal patterns (e.g., skipping breakfast, meals\\nand snacks eaten outside of the home, infrequent family dinners), unhealthful\\ndietary intake (e.g., high fat intake, low intake of fruit and vegetables, fast-\\nfood meals, low fiber intake, high soft-drink intake), psychosocial factors\\nsuch as acculturation and parenting style, and declining rates of physical ac-\\ntivity. Based on data from NHANES II and III, among children twelve to\\nseventeen years of age the prevalence of overweight increases 2 percent for\\neach additional hour of TV viewed daily.\\nPrevention is the best treatment. Restricting calories can lead to\\nstunted growth, adversely affect bone density, and even lead to eating dis-\\norders. Intervention strategies should involve the family and focus on per-\\nmanent lifestyle changes under the supervision of a primary care physician\\nor a registered dietitian. Parents can begin by limiting dining out to spe-\\ncial occasions and by making time to enjoy regular meals at home together\\nas a family. Time involved in sedentary activities such as playing video\\ngames or using the computer should be monitored and supervised, and the\\nwhole family should be encouraged to participate in thirty to sixty min-\\nutes of vigorous activity each day. To be successful, the entire family must\\nbe willing and ready to institute the many gradual, permanent changes\\nneeded.\\nPharmacological and surgical treatments are associated with long-term\\nrisks and serious complications, and they constitute, at best, a last resort for\\nseverely overweight adolescents. Prolonged weight maintenance is recom-\\nmended for many overweight children and allows a gradual decline in BMI\\nas the child grows in height.

This weight gain is related to stress,\\na sedentary lifestyle, and changes in food intake and diet patterns, and it is\\nnot unique to American college students—international students attending\\nAmerican universities become heavier, too.\\nMeal and Snack Patterns and Serving Sizes\\nMeals are often skipped by college students, and management of weight and\\nfood intake is often nonexistent or disordered. Class and work schedules\\nchange daily, as well as every semester. However, structured eating patterns\\nhelp students’ academic performance. A study by Mickey Trockel, Michael\\nBarnes, and Dennis Eggett, for example, found a positive relationship be-\\ntween eating breakfast and first-year college students’ grade-point averages.\\nLifestyle changes, peer pressure, limited finances, and access to food also\\ncontribute to erratic eating patterns. College students have little variety in their\\ndiet and often turn to high-fat snacks. A common error is underestimating\\nserving sizes, meaning they often eat more than they think they are eating.\\nFood and Nutrient Intakes of College Students\\nOf the three nutrients that provide calories (carbohydrates, proteins, and\\nfats), carbohydrate (particularly sugar) and fat intake often exceeds recom-\\nmended levels.

Among some recommendations are:\\n• Get at least eight hours of sleep a night. Lack of sleeps affects one’s\\nability to concentrate and makes one feel tired. Sleep deprivation also\\nseems to be connected with weight problems.\\n• Avoid skipping meals. When a meal is skipped, the subsequent hunger\\nmay cause one to overeat.\\n• Eat breakfast, which helps concentration and increases the likelihood\\nof consuming calcium, folic acid, and vitamin C. These nutrients are\\noften low in the diet of college students.\\n• Manage portion sizes. If portion sizes are underestimated, one may\\neat more calories than are needed. Also, the availability of a wide vari-\\nety and mass quantities of “dorm” food (pizza, soda, etc.) may pro-\\nmote overeating and a significant increase of total energy intake.\\n• Drink water and eat fruit throughout the day. Water is calorie-free\\nand fruits help manage urges to eat and contribute fiber, vitamins,\\nand minerals.\\n• Exercise regularly. Physical activity helps burn off calories, helps\\nmanage stress, and promotes mental and physical stamina.\\n• Become familiar with the campus environment and the foods that\\nare available. Most colleges and universities have a variety of eater-\\nies, each with a different format, theme, and food options.\\n• Try the low-calorie, low-fat, and vegetarian options available around\\ncampus. As part of a well-planned diet, these items can help manage\\ntotal energy intake and introduce one to items that can become part\\nof a regular diet.\\n• Keep low-fat and low-calorie snacks in the dorm room.

This was the main form of food assistance\\nfor low-income people in the United States until the Food Stamp Pro-\\ngram was expanded in the early 1970s. The Needy Family Program dis-\\ntributed surplus agricultural commodities such as cheese, butter, and other\\nitems directly to low-income people. Today, the Food and Nutrition Ser-\\nvice (FNS), an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, adminis-\\nters the nation’s commodity food distribution programs.

The program is supported by a national health or-\\nganization, the American School Health Association (ASHA), which is ac-\\ntively involved in improving the health of school-age children.\\nSchool-Age Children\\nThe major causes of death in America, such as cardiovascular disease and\\ncancer, are greatly related to lifestyle, behavior, education, and prevention\\nefforts are best focused on physical activity and diet. School-age children\\noften have poor diets, making this a critical area for CSHPs to focus on.\\nFew students are meeting the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Their di-\\nets generally lack fruit and vegetables and contain an excess of foods that\\nare high in fat. Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions, with\\ngreater numbers of people becoming affected earlier in their lives. This is\\nan important issue for school health programs, since it has been well doc-\\numented that the health of school-age children is directly related to their\\neducational success.\\nAmerican School Health Association\\nThe American School Health Association (ASHA) recognizes that schools\\ncan do more than any single agency to help young people. This national or-\\nganization unites the many professionals who are committed to improving\\nthe well being of school-age children. With more than 2,000 members,\\nASHA is comprised of counselors, health educators, physical educators,\\nschool nurses, school physicians, and administrators. Over half of members\\npractice in K-12 schools or advise and oversee health-services programs or\\nhealth education. The ASHA’s mission is to protect and improve the well-\\nbeing of children. To achieve this mission, ASHA members support the\\nCSHP.\\nThe Comprehensive School Health Program\\nThe CSHP is an “organized set of policies, procedures, and activities de-\\nsigned to protect and promote the health and well-being of students and\\nstaff” (Cottrell, Girvan, and McKenzie, p. 67). This program traditionally\\nincludes three components: health education, a healthful school envi-\\nronment, and health services.

Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.\\nCorn- or Maize-Based Diets\\nMaize, the American Indian word for corn, literally means “that which sus-\\ntains life.” After wheat and rice, it is the most important cereal grain in the\\nworld, providing nutrients for humans and animals. It also serves as a basic\\nraw material for the production of starch, oil, protein, alcoholic beverages,\\nfood sweeteners, and fuel. Maize has the highest average yield per hectare.\\nMaize is an important food in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and parts of\\nthe former Soviet Union. Each country has one or more maize dishes that\\nare unique to its culture. Examples are ogi (Nigeria), kenkey (Ghana), koga\\n(Cameroon), tô (Mali), injera (Ethiopia), and ugali (Kenya). Most of these\\nproducts are processed in traditional ways. In Africa, ground maize is cooked\\ninto a paste or mush and eaten while still warm, accompanied by a thick\\nlow-alcoholic beer. In some areas of Africa, maize mush is fried or baked.\\nIn Central and Latin American, maize is consumed in the form of maize\\nbread or tortillas.\\nMaize is also used as animal feed and raw material for industrial use. In\\nindustrialized countries, a larger proportion of the grain is used as livestock\\nfeed and as industrial raw material for food and nonfood uses. On the other\\nhand, the bulk of maize produced in developing countries is used as human\\nfood, although its use as animal feed is increasing. Maize is the largest food\\ncrop of the United States, which is responsible for 40 percent of the world’s\\nproduction.\\nMaize constitutes an important source of carbohydrates, protein, vita-\\nmin B, and minerals. As an energy source, it compares favorably with root\\nand tuber crops, and it is similar in energy value to dried legumes. Further-\\nmore, it is an excellent source of carbohydrate and is complete in nutrients\\ncompared to other cereals.\\nVarieties of Maize\\nSix general varieties of maize or corn are differentiated by the characteris-\\ntics of the kernel. Dent corn is the leading type of corn grown on U.S. farms.\\nThe sides of the kernel consist of hard, so-called horny starch, and the crown\\ncontains soft starch. As the grain matures, this soft starch shrinks, forming\\nthe characteristic dent. In flint corn, the horny starch extends over the top\\nof the kernel, so there is no denting. Popcorn, a light, highly popular snack\\nthroughout the United States, is a variant of flint corn with small kernels\\nof great hardness. When heated, the moisture in the kernels expands, caus-\\ning the kernels to pop open. Flour corn contains a preponderance of soft or\\nless densely packed starch, and it is readily ground into meal. Sweet corn is\\n133\\nCorn- or Maize-Based Diets\\nMany Africans depend on some variation\\nof this mush, which is made with water\\nand ground maize.

Pod corn is seldom used as food but is\\noften grown as a decorative plant—each kernel is enclosed in its own set of\\ndiminutive husks. Another decorative corn, commonly called Indian corn,\\nconsists of multicolored varieties of flour and flint types.\\nProtein Quality\\nThe nutritional quality of maize is determined by the amino acid makeup\\nof its protein. Maize is deficient in two essential amino acids: lysine and\\ntryptophan, making it a poor protein food. The kernel is made up of the\\nendosperm, the germ, the pericap, and the tip cap. The protein concentra-\\ntion is highest in the germ, but the quality is better in the endosperm. The\\ngerm proteins contribute significantly to essential amino acids, so maize food\\nproducts without the germ, including quality protein maize (QPM) en-\\ndosperm, are lower in protein quality compared to the whole kernel.\\nThe germ contributes most of the oil, sugar, vitamins, and minerals of\\nthe kernel. The germ also has a lower leucine to isoleucine ratio, giving it\\na higher biological value. Biological value is defined as the amount of ab-\\nsorbed nitrogen needed to provide the necessary amino acids for the dif-\\nferent metabolic functions in the body.\\nThe high consumption of maize by the human population and the well-\\nestablished lysine and tryptophan deficiencies in maize protein motivated\\nresearchers to develop the QPM to increase concentrations of these essen-\\ntial amino acids in its protein. Newer varieties provide higher protein con-\\ntent (18%) by increasing the prolamine (zein) fraction in maize endosperm.\\nAn example of QPM is one opaque-2 maize.\\nQPM varieties have almost double the percentages of lysine and tryp-\\ntophan compared to normal maize, but are similar in overall protein con-\\ntent. However, the QPM varieties have a greatly reduced amount of the\\nmajor storage protein, zein. The biological value of common maize is 45\\npercent whereas the QPM is about 80 percent. Hence the production and\\nconsumption of QPM maize in countries that use maize as their chief grain\\ncrop would have a beneficial effect on the nutritional state of the people and\\nsignificant economic implications from the better use of what is produced\\nand consumed.\\nCompared to normal maize, production of QPM varieties may have\\nsome disadvantages. QPM varieties have softer, floury endosperms, provid-\\ning a slightly lower yield and making the plant more susceptible to storage\\ninsects. Furthermore, QPM varieties have lower zein content, which is as-\\nsociated with lysine deficiency and a higher imbalance of essential amino\\nacids. Hence they are considered to be of a lower quality. They are also sus-\\nceptible to weevils in storage.\\nMinerals and Vitamins\\nThe nutritional disease pellagra, which is caused by a deficiency in niacin,\\nis associated with maize-based diets in the Americas and Africa.

The theory of food restriction holds that people de-\\nsire those foods that they feel should be avoided. According to the dietitian\\nDebra Waterhouse, food cravings do not cause weight gain, but denying the\\ncravings does. This creates a vicious cycle. For example, a person may feel\\nguilty for wanting a giant cinnamon roll that he or she smells upon enter-\\ning a shopping mall. The urge is avoided, but a couple of hours later, the\\nperson may want the cinnamon roll more than ever, give in to the craving,\\nand quickly eat the entire cinnamon roll. This leads to even stronger feel-\\nings of guilt, along with the resolve not to eat anything remotely similar for\\nsome period of time. Soon, however, the craving strikes again. The cycle\\nbecomes one of denial leading to deprivation, then to overindulgence, and\\nthen back to denial. This denial-deprivation-overindulgence pattern con-\\nfirms the negative view of all food as either good or bad. It would be bet-\\nter, however, to imagine a world where foods are not designated as bad and\\nnot allowed, but where reasonable portions of any food can be part of a\\nhealthful diet. Portion control is the key.\\nComfort Foods. Certain foods are usually served during holidays or spe-\\ncial occasions. These foods become associated with comfort and happy times,\\neliciting feelings of relaxation and reduced stress, and are thus called “com-\\nfort foods.” Some common comfort foods are ice cream, macaroni and\\ncheese, meatloaf, pudding, cookies, and chicken. One’s cultural background\\nplays a large part in comfort-food choices. Mood also plays a roll in crav-\\nings for comfort food. Women are more likely to eat when they are sad,\\nmad, or anxious, while men look to food when bored or lonely.\\nThose who find themselves reaching for comfort foods frequently\\nshould ask themselves if they are truly hungry, or whether they are using\\nfood to soothe their mood.

How do hormone changes affect food crav-\\nings? For women, these cravings can be more intense than for men. Hor-\\nmonal changes tied to the menstrual cycle are often a cause of cravings.\\nImmediately prior to the menstrual period, the body’s estrogen level drops,\\nas does the serotonin level in the brain.\\nSerotonin is a neurotransmitter, or brain chemical, that plays a role in\\nmaintaining a relaxed feeling. When the level decreases, irritability and\\nmood swings increase as does the craving for carbohydrate- and fat-rich\\nfoods such as chocolate, cookies, cake, potato chips, and roasted nuts. There\\nis nothing wrong with eating a piece of chocolate, of course, but when choco-\\nlate and other craved foods become the mainstay of the diet and healthier\\nchoices get overlooked, then the cravings have gotten out of control and\\nhealth may be compromised.\\nGender Differences. Is there a difference between the sexes when it\\ncomes to food cravings? According to Waterhouse, the foods most fre-\\nquently craved or preferred by men include hot dogs, eggs, and meat, which\\nare all proteinfoods, while women reach for chocolate, ice cream, and bread.\\nShe attributes these differences to sex hormones and body composition. Men\\nhave larger amounts of the hormone testosterone and about forty pounds\\n137\\nCravings\\ndiet: the total daily food intake, or the\\ntypes of foods eaten\\nhormone: molecules produced by one\\nset of cells that influence the function of\\nanother set of cells\\nestrogen: hormone that helps control fe-\\nmale development and menstruation\\nserotonin: chemical used by nerve cells\\nto communicate with one another\\nneurotransmitter:molecule released by\\none nerve cell to stimulate or inhibit an-\\nother\\nprotein: complex molecule composed of\\namino acids that performs vital functions\\nin the cell; necessary part of the diet\\ntestosterone: male sex hormone\\nPregnancy Cravings\\nIs there any truth to the belief\\nthat pregnant women suffer in-\\ntense cravings for particular\\nfoods, sometimes in odd combi-\\nnations? Absolutely. According\\nto medical researchers, preg-\\nnant women experiencing\\nchanges in hormones and an\\nincreased need for calories\\nfrequently exhibit changes in\\nthe types of foods they prefer.\\nCommon cravings include fruit,\\nmilk products, salty foods,\\nchocolate, and other sweets. In\\nthe early stages of pregnancy,\\nwomen often have a strong\\naversion to bitter tastes, which\\nscientists think may serve as a\\nwarning against ingesting toxic\\nplants or fruits during the period\\nwhen a fetus is most vulnerable.\\nIn later stages of pregnancy,\\nwomen often exhibit preferences\\nfor salty foods (which satisfy\\ntheir increased need for sodium)\\nand sour foods (which contribute\\nto a varied diet).

Therefore, the future\\nhealth of the U.S. population as a whole will be influenced substantially by\\nimprovements in the health of racial and ethnic minorities.\\nCultural, ethnic, linguistic, and economic differences impact how indi-\\nviduals and groups access and use health, education, and social services. They\\ncan also present barriers to effective education and health care interventions.\\nThis is especially true when health educators or health care practitioners\\nstereotype, misinterpret, make faulty assumptions, or otherwise mishandle\\ntheir encounters with individuals and groups viewed as different in terms of\\ntheir backgrounds and experiences. The demand for culturally competent\\nhealth care in the United States is a direct result of the failure of the health\\ncare system to provide adequate care to all segments of the population.\\nCultural Competence, Cultural Sensitivity, \\nand Culturally Effective Health Care\\nThe term cultural competence refers to the ability to work effectively with in-\\ndividuals from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, or in settings where\\nseveral cultures coexist. It includes the ability to understand the language,\\nculture, and behaviors of other individuals and groups, and to make appro-\\npriate recommendations.

Developing cultural awareness includes rec-\\nognizing the value of population diversity. It also means an honest assess-\\nment of one’s biases and stereotypes.\\nAcquiring Knowledge. One can never learn everything about another\\nculture. However, acquiring knowledge about other groups is the founda-\\ntion of cultural competence. In addition to understanding other cultures, it is\\nessential to understand how different cultural groups view one’s own culture.\\nKnowledge of another culture includes assessments of facts not only about\\nrelevant norms, values, worldviews, and the practicality of everyday life, but\\nalso about how one’s culture and the services one provides are viewed.\\nDeveloping and Maintaining Cross-Cultural Skills. Even though\\nthe United States is a pluralistic society, most health professionals have\\nbeen trained in a monocultural tradition. In addition, many continue to\\npractice as if ethnic and cultural differences are insignificant. Cross-cultural\\nskills are developed through formal coursework, informal interaction and\\nnetworking, and experience.\\nOrganizational Responsibilities\\nIt is important for health care organizations and professional preparation\\nprograms to articulate a commitment to cultural competence and to initi-\\nate cultural-competence initiatives. Many organizations are getting social\\nand legal pressures to do this from different segments of the population. In\\naddition to the social impact of diversity, these organizations are beginning\\nto realize that a commitment to diversity makes good business sense.\\nProfessional preparation programs can play a significant role in provid-\\ning the knowledge and skills for culturally competent health professionals.\\nThese programs can provide courses and other formats developed with the\\nsole purpose of addressing cultural competence and/or cultural sensitivity.\\n140\\nCultural Competence\\nCultural competence cannot be achieved\\nthrough short workshops or classes.

Insulin, a hormone secreted\\nby the pancreas, helps the body use and store glucose produced during the\\ndigestion of food. Characterized by hyperglycemia, symptoms of diabetes\\ninclude frequent urination, increased thirst, dehydration, weight loss,\\nblurred vision, fatigue, and, occasionally, coma. Uncontrolled hyper-\\nglycemia over time damages the eyes, nerves, blood vessels, kidneys, and\\nheart, causing organ dysfunction and failure. A number of risk factors are\\nattributed to the incidenceof diabetes, including family history, age, eth-\\nnicity, and social group characteristics, as well as behavioral , lifestyle,\\npsychological, and clinical factors.\\nThe World Health Organization estimates that 150 million people had\\ndiabetes worldwide in 2002. This number is projected to double by the year\\n2025. Much of this increase will occur in developing countries and will be\\ndue to population growth, aging, unhealthful diets, obesity, and sedentary\\nlifestyles. In the United States, diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death.\\nWhile 6.2 percent of the population has diabetes, an estimated 5.9 million\\npeople are unaware they have the disease. In addition, about 19 percent of\\nall deaths in the United States for those age twenty-five and older are due\\nto diabetes-related complications.\\nThe prevalence of diabetes varies by age, gender, race, and ethnicity.\\nIn the United States, about 0.19 percent of the population less than twenty\\nyears of age (151,000 people) have diabetes, versus 8.6 percent of the pop-\\nulation twenty years of age and older. In addition, adults sixty-five and older\\naccount for 40 percent of those with diabetes, despite composing only 12\\npercent of the population. Considerable variations also exist in the preva-\\nlence of diabetes among various racial and ethnic groups. For example, 7.8\\npercent of non-Hispanic whites, 13 percent of non-Hispanic blacks, 10.2\\npercent of Hispanic/Latino Americans, and 15.1 percent of American Indi-\\nans and Alaskan Natives have diabetes.

In type 1 diabetes, specialized cells in the pancreas are\\ndestroyed, leading to a deficiency in insulin production. Type 1 diabetes fre-\\nquently develops over the course of a few days or weeks.

Type 2 diabetes\\nis also more common in blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and women,\\nespecially women with a history of gestational diabetes.\\nGenetics and environmental factors are the main contributors to type\\n2 diabetes. Physical inactivity and adoption of a Western lifestyle (particu-\\nlarly choosing foods with more animal protein, animal fats, and processed\\ncarbohydrates), especially in indigenous people in North American and\\nwithin ethnic groups and migrants, have contributed to weight gain and\\nobesity. In fact, obesity levels increased by 74 percent between 1991 and\\n2003. Increased body fat and abdominal obesity are associated with insulin\\nresistance, a precursor to diabetes. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and\\nimpaired fasting glucose (IFG) are two prediabetic conditions associated with\\ninsulin resistance. In these conditions, the blood glucose concentration is\\nabove the normal range, but below levels required to diagnose diabetes. Sub-\\njects with IGT and/or IFG are at substantially higher risk of developing dia-\\nbetes and cardiovasculardisease than those with normal glucose tolerance.\\nThe conversion of individuals with IGT to type 2 diabetes varies with eth-\\nnicity, anthropometric measures related to obesity, fasting blood glucose\\n(a measurement of blood glucose values after not eating for 12 to 14 hours),\\nand the two-hour post-glucose load level (a measurement of blood glucose\\ntaken exactly two hours after eating). In addition to IGT and IFG, higher\\nthan normal levels of fasting insulin, called hyperinsulinemia, are associated\\nwith an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Insulin levels are higher\\nin African Americans than in whites, particularly African-American women,\\nindicating their greater predisposition for developing type 2 diabetes.\\nThe complexity of inheritance and interaction with the environment\\nmakes identification of genes involved with type 2 diabetes difficult. Only\\na small percentage (2–5%) of diabetes cases can be explained by single gene\\ndefects and are usually atypical cases. However, a “thrifty gene,” although\\nnot yet identified, is considered predictive of weight gain and the develop-\\nment of type 2 diabetes. Thrifty-gene theory suggests that indigenous\\npeople who experienced alternating periods of feast and famine gradually\\ndeveloped a way to store fat more efficiently during periods of plenty to\\nbetter survive famines. Regardless of the thrifty gene, the contribution of\\ngenetic mutations in the development of type 2 diabetes has not been estab-\\nlished, due to the number of genes that may be involved.\\nGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as any degree of glucose\\nintolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. This definition\\napplies regardless of whether insulin or diet modification is used for treat-\\nment, and whether or not the condition persists after pregnancy. GDM\\naffects up to 14 percent of the pregnant population—approximately 135,000\\nwomen per year in United States. GDM complicates about 4 percent of all\\npregnancies in the U.S. Women at greatest risk for developing GDM are\\nobese, older than twenty-five years of age, have a previous history of ab-\\nnormal glucose control, have first-degree relatives with diabetes, or are\\nmembers of ethnic groups with a high prevalence of diabetes.

Drugs, infections, and dis-\\neases cause diabetes by damaging the pancreas and/or impairing insulin\\naction or secretion.\\nDiabetes Complications\\nPeople with diabetes are at increased risk for serious long-term complica-\\ntions. Hyperglycemia, as measured by fasting plasma glucose concentration\\nor glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), causes structural and functional\\nchanges in the retina, nerves, kidneys, and blood vessels.

Both DKA and HHS result from an insulin deficiency and an\\nincrease in counter-regulatory hormones (a.k.a. hyperglycemia). Hyper-\\nglycemia leads to glycosuria (glucose in the urine), increased urine output,\\nand dehydration. Because the glucose is excreted in the urine, the body\\nbecomes starved for energy. At this point, the body either continues to\\nexcrete glucose in the urine making the hyperglycemia worse (HHS), or the\\nbody begins to break down triglycerides causing the release of ketones\\n(by-products of fat breakdown) into the urine and bloodstream (DKA).\\nThe mortality rate of patients with DKA is less than 5 percent while the\\nmortality rate of HHS patients is about 15 percent. Infection (urinary tract\\ninfections and pneumonia account for 30 to 50 percent of cases), omission\\nof insulin, and increased amounts of counter-regulatory hormones con-\\ntribute to DKA and HHS. Type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients may experi-\\nence DKA and HHS. However, DKA is more common in type 1 diabetic\\npatients, while HHS is more common in type 2 diabetic patients. Treat-\\nment of DKA and HHS involves correction of dehydration, hyperglycemia,\\nketoacidosis, and electrolyte deficits and imbalances.\\n146\\nDiabetes Mellitus\\nketoacidosis: accumulation of ketone\\nbodies along with high acid levels in the\\nbody fluids\\nenergy: technically, the ability to per-\\nform work; the content of a substance\\nthat allows it to be useful as a fuel\\ntriglyceride: a type of fat\\nketones: chemicals produced by fat\\nbreakdown; molecule containing a double-\\nbonded oxygen linked to two carbons\\npneumonia: lung infection\\nelectrolyte: salt dissolved in fluid\\ndrugs: substances whose administration\\ncauses a significant change in the body’s\\nfunction\\nplasma: the fluid portion of the blood,\\ndistinct from the cellular portion\\nhemoglobin: the iron-containing mole-\\ncule in red blood cells that carries oxygen'),\n",

When\\nmedication fails, insulin is required.\\nFollowing the diagnosis of diabetes, a diabetic patient undergoes med-\\nical nutrition therapy. In other words, a registered dietician performs a\\nnutritional assessment to evaluate the diabetic patient’s food intake, meta-\\nbolic status, lifestyle, and readiness to make changes, along with providing\\ndietary instruction and goal setting. The assessment is individualized and\\ntakes into account cultural, lifestyle, and financial considerations. The goals\\nof medical nutrition therapy are to attain appropriate blood glucose, lipid,\\ncholesterol, and triglyceride levels, which are critical to preventing the\\nchroniccomplications associated with diabetes. For meal planning, the\\ndiabetic exchange system provides a quick method for estimating and main-\\ntaining the proper balance of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and calories. In\\nthe exchange system, foods are categorized into groups, with each group\\nhaving food with similar amounts of carbohydrate, protein, fat, and calo-\\nries.

It is an important area of focus due not\\nonly to its high worldwide prevalence and health costs, but also because it\\ncan be significantly reduced by appropriate interventions and treatment.\\nDiarrhea has various causes and symptoms, resulting in a wide range of\\ndefinitions for this illness. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)\\ndefines diarrhea as loose, watery stools occurring more than three times a\\nday, which is the most common definition. The term acute diarrhea is used\\nto describe an episode lasting less than three weeks. Persistent diarrhea is an\\nepisode that lasts more than fourteen days, and chronic diarrhea is the term\\nfor recurring episodes of diarrhea. Dysentery is diarrhea that contains blood.\\nThe severity of diarrhea ranges from asymptomatic to severe dehydration\\nresulting in death.\\nCauses of Diarrhea\\nDiarrhea can present in many ways because it has many potential causes.\\nMost cases of diarrhea are caused by some type of infection. For example,\\nsurveillance studies in rural Bangladesh have cited infection as the cause of\\n86 percent of the cases of diarrhea in that population. This is the case in\\nmuch of the developing world. Regardless of the cause, diarrhea results from\\nan alteration of the lining of the wall of the intestines. Normal digestion\\noccurs when there is a balance of fluid and nutrients across the bowel wall.\\nDisruption of this process can be caused directly by organisms, toxins, or\\nimmune reactions. Any imbalance alters the composition of the stool and the\\nmotility (motion) of the bowel wall, resulting in an increased loss of fluid and\\nnutrients. Dehydration is the result of loss of body fluids and electrolytes.\\nA loss of 5 percent of body weight can result in a rapid heart rate, dizziness,\\ndecreased urination, disorientation, and even coma. A 10 percent loss of body\\nweight caused by severe diarrhea can lead to acidosis, shock, and death.\\nPeople in developing countries suffer most from infectious forms of\\ndiarrhea. Most infections pass through a fecal-oral route. This results from\\nenvironmental causes such as poor sanitation, decreased access to clean\\nwater, and a poor understanding of transmission and treatment of disease.\\nThese are conditions that arise most frequently in the developing world,\\nthough they affect both rural and urban populations. Improvements in these\\nareas result in a dramatic reduction of cases of infectious diarrhea, as shown\\nin studies in numerous developing nations, such as India, Gambia, and else-\\nwhere, where poor socioeconomic status affects a large percentage of the\\npopulation. Traveler’s diarrhea is the result of exposure to such infectious\\nagents when visiting countries where sanitation is inadequate.\\nDiarrhea in Developing Nations\\nDiarrhea is a major cause of death in much of the world, particularly in de-\\nveloping nations, where the effect is greatest among the young. The World\\nHealth Organization (WHO) attributes 3.5 million deaths a year to diar-\\nrhea, with 80 percent of these deaths occurring in children under the age\\nof five, and most occurring in children between six months and three years\\nof age. Children are the most susceptible because a smaller amount of fluid\\n149\\nDiarrhea\\nprevalence: describing the number of\\ncases in a population at any one time\\nacute: rapid-onset and short-lived\\nchronic: over a long period\\nasymptomatic: without symptoms\\ndehydration: loss of water\\nintestines: the two long tubes that carry\\nout the bulk of the processes of digestion\\nnutrient: dietary substance necessary\\nfor health\\nbowel: intestines and rectum\\ntoxins: poison\\nelectrolyte: salt dissolved in fluid\\nacidosis: elevated acid level in the blood\\nshock: state of dangerously low blood\\npressure and loss of blood delivered to\\nthe tissues\\nsocioeconomic status: level of income\\nand social class\\nDiarrhea\\nMalnutrition\\nDecreased\\nImmunity\\nExposure\\nTHE CYCLE OF DIARRHEAL\\nILLNESS'),\n",

Most of these cases are infectious diarrhea. Infectious diar-\\nrhea also contributes to malnutrition due to a decreased nutritional intake\\nand diminished absorption of vital nutrients during the acute episode and\\nrecovery period. Malnutrition, in turn, decreases the ability of the immune\\nsystem to fight further infections, making diarrheal episodes more frequent.\\nStudies have shown that poor nutritional status can double the risk of\\ncontracting diarrhea when exposed to an infectious agent. In addition, the\\nduration of the acute episode can be up to three times as long in malnour-\\nished children. In addition, reduced immunity and deficiencies of nutrients\\nsuch as vitamin A and zinc, which are common in malnourished individuals,\\ncan increase the health risks from diarrhea. Diarrhea also causes decreased\\nappetite and food intake, decreased absorption of nutrients from the food\\nthat is ingested, and increased catabolism of body proteins. The resulting\\nundernutrition stunts future mental and physical development.\\nEating patterns before and after diarrheal episodes play an important\\nrole in this cycle. In developing countries, environmental factors, such as\\npervasive bacterial contamination of water used for drinking, cooking, and\\ncleaning, contribute to continued exposure to agents that cause diarrhea.\\nMaternal practices related to feeding are also a factor. Reduced breastfeed-\\ning rates in developing nations mean that fewer children receive the pro-\\ntective and nutritional benefits of breast milk. Nursing allows for the delivery\\nof milk high in fats, proteins, and calories in a sterile fashion. When illness\\ncauses mothers to wean their children too early, nutritious breast milk is\\nreplaced with cereals and gruels that are often low in calories and proteins\\nand are made with contaminated water. Commercial formulas are also of-\\nten diluted with contaminated water and put in bottles that are not sterile.\\nA lack of maternal education often leads to the common practice of with-\\nholding food during acute episodes of diarrhea out of fear that eating will\\nexacerbate the symptoms.

It is one of four parts of a nutrition assessment done in a clinical set-\\nting. These four parameters of assessment include: (1) an assessment of\\nanthropometrics(weight, height, weight-to-height ratio, head circumfer-\\nence, body mass index, etc.); (2) dietary assessment, which includes a diet\\nhistory or food frequency analysis; (3) a physical examination with a med-\\nical history; and (4) biochemical exams or blood/urine tests.\\nReviewing a person’s dietary data may suggest risk factors for chronic\\ndiseases and help to prevent them. Laboratory tests may uncover malnutri-\\ntion and detect problems before any side effects appear, such as the tired-\\nness and apathy associated with iron-deficiency anemia. The strengths of a\\nsimple blood test and food intake record are that these are easy to do and\\nare affordable and appropriate for most people.\\nProblems with using diet histories can occur because a person’s mem-\\nory about what he or she ate earlier may not be accurate. It can also be time-\\nconsuming to collect food intake records. There are also problems with\\ninterpreting food intakes, laboratory values, and appropriate weights and\\nheights.\\nA final area of concern related to dietary assessment is what to do with\\nthe information once it has been gathered. Providing nutrition education\\nand counseling to people of different ages and from different backgrounds\\nrequires a great deal of skill and a good understanding of diet quality, nor-\\nmal eating, and normal physical and psychosocial development. It is im-\\nportant to treat people as individuals with unique needs and concerns.\\nDietitians are trained to do this, but many health care workers are not trained\\nto measure diet quality, define dietary moderation, or provide counseling.\\nSEE ALSO Nutritional Assessment.\\nDelores Truesdell\\nInternet Resources\\nAmerican Heart Association. “Healthy Lifestyle: Diet and Nutrition.” Available from\\n<http://www.americanheart.org>\\nU.S. Department of Agriculture (2000). “Dietary Guidelines for Americans,” 5th edi-\\ntion.

They are designed to help Americans make\\nfood choices that promote health and reduce the risk of disease. The guide-\\nlines are published jointly by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)\\nand U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The first set\\nof guidelines was published as Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines\\nfor Americans in 1980. Since then, an advisory committee has been appointed\\nevery five years to review and revise the guidelines based on the latest re-\\nsearch in nutrition and health.\\nEarly Dietary Advice in the United States\\nThe first half of the twentieth century was a period of enormous growth in\\nnutrition knowledge. The primary goal of nutrition advice at this time was\\nto help people select foods to meet their energy (calorie) needs and pre-\\nvent nutritional deficiencies. During the Great Depression of the 1930s,\\nfood was rationed and people had little money to buy food. They needed\\nto know how to select an adequate diet with few resources, and the USDA\\nproduced a set of meal plans that were affordable for families of various in-\\ncomes. To this day, a food guide for low-income families—the Thrifty Food\\nPlan—is issued regularly by the USDA and used to determine food stamp\\nallotments. In addition to meal plans, the USDA developed food guides—\\ntools to help people select healthful diets. Over the years the food guides\\nchanged, based on the current information available.\\nFood Guides versus Dietary Guidelines\\nFood guides are practical tools that people can use to select a healthful diet.\\nFood guide recommendations, such as how many servings of grains to eat,\\nare based on dietary guidelines that are overall recommendations for health-\\nful diets. For example, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans include the\\nrecommendation that Americans “choose a variety of grains daily, especially\\nwhole grains.” To help people reach this goal, the USDA’s Food Guide\\nPyramid is built on a base of grain foods and recommends six to eleven serv-\\nings daily with several servings from whole grains. Thus, the Food Guide\\nPyramid supports the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines.\\nEvolution of the Dietary Guidelines\\nDuring the 1970s, scientists began identifying links between people’s usual\\neating habits and their risk for chronic diseases such as heart disease and\\ncancer. They realized that a healthful diet was important not only to pre-\\nvent nutrient deficiencies, but because it might play a role in decreasing\\nthe risk for chronic diseases. Since heart disease and cancer were, and still\\nare, major causes of death and disability in the United States, there was a\\nneed to help Americans select health-promoting diets.\\nThe first major step in federal dietary guidance was the 1977 publica-\\ntion of Dietary Goals for the United States by the Senate Select Committee\\non Nutrition and Human Needs, which recommended an increased intake\\nof carbohydrates and a reduced intake of fat, saturated fat, cholesterol,\\n153\\nDietary Guidelines\\nnutrition: the maintenance of health\\nthrough proper eating, or the study of\\nsame\\nenergy: technically, the ability to per-\\nform work; the content of a substance\\nthat allows it to be useful as a fuel\\ncalorie: unit of food energy\\nnutritional deficiency: lack of adequate\\nnutrients in the diet\\ndiet:the total daily food intake, or the\\ntypes of foods eaten\\nchronic: over a long period\\nheart disease: any disorder of the heart\\nor its blood supply, including heart attack,\\natherosclerosis, and coronary artery \\ndisease\\ncancer: uncontrolled cell growth\\nnutrient: dietary substance necessary\\nfor health\\ncarbohydrate:food molecule made of\\ncarbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, including\\nsugars and starches\\nfat: type of food molecule rich in carbon\\nand hydrogen, with high energy content\\nsaturated fat: a fat with the maximum\\npossible number of hydrogens; more dif-\\nficult to break down that unsaturated fats\\ncholesterol: multi-ringed molecule found\\nin animal cell membranes; a type of lipid'),\n",

There was heated debate among nutrition scientists when\\nthe Dietary Goals were published. Some nutritionists believed that not\\nenough was known about effects of diet and health to make suggestions as\\nspecific as those given.\\nIn 1980, the first edition of Dietary Guidelines for Americans was re-\\nleased by the USDA and HHS. The seven guidelines were: (1) Eat a variety\\nof foods; (2) Maintain ideal weight; (3) Avoid too much fat, saturated fat,\\nand cholesterol; (4) Eat foods with adequate starch and fiber; (5) Avoid too\\nmuch sugar; (6) Avoid too much sodium; and (7) If you drink alcohol, do\\nso in moderation. The second edition, released in 1985, made a few changes,\\nbut kept most of the guidelines intact. Two exceptions were the weight\\nguideline, which was changed to “Maintain desirable weight” and the last\\nguideline, in which “alcohol” was changed to “alcoholic beverages.”\\nFollowing publication of the second edition of the Dietary Guidelines,\\ntwo influential reports concerning diet and health were issued. The Surgeon\\nGeneral’s Report on Nutrition and Health was published in 1988, and the\\nNational Research Council’s report Diet and Health—Implications for Reduc-\\ning Chronic Disease Risk was published in 1989. These two reports supported\\nthe goal of the Dietary Guidelines to promote eating habits that can help\\npeople stay healthy. In 1990, the third edition of the guidelines took a more\\npositive tone than previous editions, using phrases such as “Choose a diet...”\\nor “Use ... only in moderation,” rather than “Avoid too much...” This was\\nseen as a positive step by many nutrition educators.\\nThe fourth edition was the first to include the Food Guide Pyramid,\\nwhich had been introduced in 1992. It also was the first edition to address\\nvegetarian diets and the recently introduced “Nutrition Facts” panel for food\\nlabels. The fifth edition, issued in 2000, expanded the number of guidelines\\nto ten and organized them into three messages: “Aim for Fitness, Build a\\nHealthy Base, and Choose Sensibly” (ABC).\\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans have evolved since they were first\\npublished in 1980. Their recommendations represent the latest research in\\ndiet and health promotion, and, as new research emerges, the guidelines will\\ncontinue to change to reflect new insights into diet and health.

DRIs include four sets of\\nnutrient standards: Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), Recommended\\nDietary Allowance (RDA), Adequate Intake (AI), and Tolerable Upper In-\\ntake Level (UL). Starting in the mid-1990s, DRIs began to replace RDAs\\nand Recommended Nutrient Intakes for Canadians, which had been the\\nstandards for the United States and for Canada, respectively.\\nEach component of the DRIs has a unique purpose. The EARs are av-\\nerage nutrient requirements for a population group (e.g., females ages 19–30).\\nThey are used in nutrition research and to set nutrition policy. RDA values\\nare based on the EARs. RDA values represent a level of nutrient intake that\\nwould meet the needs of about 97 percent of people in a particular group.\\nIf there is not enough information to set RDA values, then an AI may\\nbe established for that nutrient. The AI is based on information about av-\\nerage intake of the nutrient by a healthy group of people. RDA and AI are\\nboth used to plan healthful diets for individuals.\\nNot only is it important to know how much of a nutrient is needed for\\ngood health, it is also critical to know how much of a nutrient is too much.\\nThe UL is the highest intake of a nutrient that does not pose a threat to\\nhealth for most people.

In 1994, the U.S. Congress formally defined the term dietary supple-\\nment as a product taken by mouth that contains a “dietary ingredient” in-\\ntended to supplement the diet. The dietary ingredients in these products\\nmay include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, enzymes, organ tis-\\nsues, glandulars, and metabolites. Dietary supplements can also be extracts\\nor concentrates, and may be found in many forms, such as tablets, capsules,\\nliquids, or powders.\\nThe use of dietary supplements is widespread—they are taken by half of\\nAmerican adults.

Herbs, one type of dietary supplement, are widely used through-\\nout the world. In China, traditional medicine encompasses a holistic ap-\\nproach to healing, and herbal remedies are routinely included in self-care.\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in developing coun-\\ntries up to 80 percent of indigenous populations rely on herbs for primary\\nhealth care needs. In France and Germany, 30 to 40 percent of all medical\\ndoctors rely on herbal preparations as their primary medicines.\\nRegulation of Dietary Supplements\\nIn 1994 the U.S. Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Ed-\\nucation Act (DSHEA), which President Bill Clinton signed into law the same\\nyear. One provision of DSHEA clarified the definition for dietary supple-\\nments outlined above. DSHEA also mandated the establishment of the Of-\\nfice of Dietary Supplements (ODS) within the National Institutes of Health.\\nThe ODS coordinates research on dietary supplements and acts as a clear-\\ninghouse for regulatory issues. It also maintains an excellent resource for\\nconsumers, the International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supple-\\nments (IBIDS), which is a database that contains citations published in sci-\\nentific journals on the topic of dietary supplements. The public can access\\nIBIDS on the ODS website.\\nDSHEA established a new regulatory framework for supplement safety\\nand for the labeling of dietary supplements by the U.S. Food and Drug Ad-\\nministration (FDA). Dietary supplements are regulated under food law, but\\nwith certain provisions that apply only to dietary supplements. For example,\\ndietary supplements escape the stringent approval process that food additives\\nand drugs must go through before being marketed to the public, unless the\\nmanufacturer of a dietary supplement makes a claim for therapeutic efficacy.\\nDSHEA also gave manufacturers the freedom to provide information\\nabout product benefits on labels through three types of claims. Health claims\\ndescribe a relationship between a food substance and a disease or health-\\nrelated condition. For example, the health claim “diets high in calcium\\nmay reduce the risk of osteoporosis” has been authorized by the FDA and\\nmay appear on the labels of dietary supplements. Structure function claims\\nmay state a benefit related to a nutrient-deficiency disease (such as scurvy,\\nwhich is caused by a deficiency of vitamin C), as long as the statement tells\\nhow widespread the disease is. These claims may also describe the role of a\\nnutrient intended to affect a structure or function—for example, “antioxi-\\ndants maintain cell integrity,” or “calcium builds strong bones.” Nutrient\\ncontent claims describe the level of a nutrient or dietary substance in a prod-\\nuct, using FDA-regulated terms such as “good source,” “high,” or “free.”\\nFor example, if a label claims a dietary supplement is fat-free, the supple-\\nment must contain less than 0.5 grams of fat per serving.\\nHowever, information on supplement labels cannot be false or mis-\\nleading. For example, statements that a product will treat, cure, or diagnose\\na disease are reserved for drugs. That is why the label of the popular herbal\\nextract echinacea may boast that the herb “supports good immune function”\\nbut will not claim to “cure your cold.”\\n156\\nDietary Supplements\\nBaby Boomers and\\nNutritional Supplements\\nInformed, prosperous, and\\nhealth-conscious, the baby\\nboomers are known as a gen-\\neration that plans to fight vigor-\\nously against the encroachments\\nof age. During the 1990s, as the\\nboomers began reaching their\\nfifties, they increasingly turned\\nto supplements to ward off os-\\nteoporosis, memory loss, and a\\nhost of other ailments. With in-\\ncreased demand, the vitamins,\\nminerals, and herbs they\\nsought migrated from health\\nfood stores to mass merchan-\\ndisers.

He contrasts the development of\\na new dietary supplement to that of a new drug or food additive, for which\\nthere is a formal process to evaluate safety.\\nA manufacturer developing a new drug or food additive must conduct\\nsafety studies following FDA procedures. Results must be submitted to the\\nFDA for review and approval before the ingredient or drug can be sold to\\nthe public. This is not the case for dietary supplements, however, because\\nunder DSHEA they are legally in a class by themselves. The FDA must sim-\\nply be notified of the new product, and the notification must provide in-\\nformation that supports the manufacturer’s claim that its product is safe.\\nOnce the product is marketed, the FDA is responsible for proving that a di-\\netary supplement is unsafe before it can take action to restrict that prod-\\nuct’s use or remove it from the marketplace.\\nAnother issue critics of DSHEA cite is the scant quality control of di-\\netary supplements. Quality control is important to assure consumers that a\\nproduct contains the ingredients stated on the label in the stated amounts.\\nNeither the FDA nor any other federal or state agency routinely tests di-\\netary supplements for quality prior to sale. But some manufacturers of di-\\netary supplements do adhere to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) and\\nmake every effort to produce a quality product. Also, the FDA has assisted\\nthe industry by proposing GMPs that focus on ensuring the identity, pu-\\nrity, quality, strength, and composition of dietary supplements.\\nDSHEA supporters fear that increased regulation of dietary supplements\\nwill decrease access to beneficial products. National opinion surveys show\\nthat many supplement users feel so strongly about the potential health ben-\\nefits of supplements that they would continue to use them even if the sup-\\nplements were shown to be ineffective in clinical studies. Consumers value\\nfreedom of choice, and many view regulation as an attempt by the govern-\\nment and medical establishment to monopolize treatment options. Clearly,\\na balance needs to be reached between preserving freedom of choice and\\nensuring that dietary supplements are safe and effective.

Concerns about the safety of the food supply are on the\\nrise, and increasing nutritional awareness has led to an increase in vegetar-\\nian, organic, and health-food options in supermarkets. “Lite” food is in, and\\nindulgence is out. But are Americans practicing what they preach? A closer\\nlook at American dietary trends reveals that parts of the American diet are\\nstill lacking in nutritional quality, despite consumer demand for healthier\\noptions.\\nDietary Patterns\\nFruit and vegetable intake, although rising, is still below the five servings\\nper day recommended in the USDA’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\\nThe average American eats one and one-half servings of vegetables and one\\nserving of fruit per day. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, con-\\nsumption of milk and eggs has been declining, while cheese consumption\\nhas gone up. Meat, poultry, and fish intake has climbed dramatically. Grain\\nand cereal consumption has also risen. Vegetable fats are increasingly be-\\ning used instead of animal fats, but total fat consumption is still high.\\nSixty percent of Americans eat snack food regularly, consuming about\\n20 percent of their calories from snacks. Because half of young adults skip\\nbreakfast, and one-fourth skip lunch, between-meal eating contributes sig-\\nnificantly to the daily nutrient intakes of Americans. Children, in particu-\\nlar, require several small meals per day, as their stomachs cannot hold large\\namounts of food at one time. Carefully chosen snacks can add to good di-\\netary habits. Most Americans, however, do not snack wisely.\\nMore than 30 percent of men and more than 40 percent of women take\\na daily multivitamin/mineral supplement. Doses of about 100 percent of the\\nDaily Value (DV) of most nutrients are common in these supplements. Al-\\nthough nutrition experts agree that the average American does not need\\nsupplements, there is little harm in taking them. Problems can arise, how-\\never, when individual nutrients are taken. Megadoses of certain minerals\\nand relatively low supplemental doses of certain fat-soluble vitamins can\\nlead to toxicity. For example, a surplus of vitamin A can lead to cheilitis\\n(cracking and inflammation of the lips), dryness of the nasal mucosa and\\neyes, hair loss, and, eventually, liver damage. Megadoses of vitamin D can\\nlead to the calcification of soft tissues, such as the lungs, heart, and kidneys.\\n159\\nDietary Trends, American\\ndiet: the total daily food intake, or the\\ntypes of foods eaten\\nfat: type of food molecule rich in carbon\\nand hydrogen, with high energy content\\ncalorie: unit of food energy\\nnutrient: dietary substance necessary\\nfor health\\nnutrition: the maintenance of health\\nthrough proper eating, or the study of\\nsame\\nmineral: an inorganic (non-carbon-\\ncontaining) element, ion or compound\\nvitamin:necessary complex nutrient\\nused to aid enzymes or other metabolic\\nprocesses in the cell\\nmucosa: moist exchange surface within\\nthe body\\nvitamin D: nutrient needed for calcium\\nuptake and therefore proper bone forma-\\ntion'),\n",

Available\\nfrom <http://www.barc.usda.gov/bhnrc/foodsurvey>\\nDietary Trends, International\\nWhat foods an individual eats is affected by the ability to access foods. Eco-\\nnomic status, geography, and politics have influenced the diets of people\\nthroughout history. Poverty is linked to malnutrition, while economic\\ngrowth and a rise in population pose new nutritional problems. Ironically,\\ndiets high in complex carbohydrates and fiber in poor economic times give\\nway to consumption of foods high in sugars and fat when economic condi-\\ntions improve.\\nBetween 1995 and 1997, among countries that showed an increase in\\nper capita incomes, average caloric consumption also showed a significant\\nincrease. Between 1970 and 1972, and between 1996 and 1997, world con-\\nsumption of calories from complex carbohydrates fell by 30 percent while\\nthe consumption of calories from meat increased by a third (33%) and those\\nfrom vegetable oil by almost half (46.2%). As nations become wealthier,\\npeople move from eating “a poor man’s diet” of high levels of grains, fruits,\\nand vegetables to consuming diets with more fats and sugar. Fat still re-\\nmains the food for the rich—with more income, people start to eat more\\nmeat and poultry, and vegetable oils become more available. Combined with\\ncane and corn sugars, vegetable oils are used to produce baked goods and\\nsnack foods high in calories.\\n162\\nDietary Trends, International\\nmalnutrition: chronic lack of sufficient\\nnutrients to maintain health\\ncarbohydrate: food molecule made of\\ncarbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, including\\nsugars and starches\\nfiber: indigestible plant material that aids\\ndigestion by providing bulk\\nfat: type of food molecule rich in carbon\\nand hydrogen, with high energy content\\ncalorie:unit of food energy\\ndiet: the total daily food intake, or the\\ntypes of foods eaten'),\n",

Industrialization and modern transportation brought bak-\\ning technology and Western food styles to developing countries. New and\\ntasty foods high in fat, sugar, and salt became the choice of the new rich.\\nTrendy fast foods, soft drinks, and meat products replaced traditional eth-\\nnic foods.\\nFortunately, in many emerging societies the poor are still unable to af-\\nford Western fast foods, and are thus spared the ills of high consumption\\nof fats, meat, and sugars. For example, many people in India still spend more\\nthan half their income on food consumed at home, compared to the aver-\\nage American, who spends less than 8 percent of his or her disposable in-\\ncome on home-cooked food.\\nThe American diet, much like that of many industrialized nations, de-\\nrives its calories from fats, sugars, and animal products in foods prepared or\\nprocessed away from home. One out of every three meals in America is con-\\nsumed away from home. From 1990 to 2000 there was a 14 percent decrease\\nin the number of meals eaten at home. In 1977 only 16 percent of all meals\\nand snacks were eaten way from home. By 1995, this rose to 27 percent. In\\n1995, away-from-home foods provided 34 percent of total caloric intake,\\nan increase from 18 percent in 1977. In addition, eating at home does not\\nalways mean cooking. Supermarkets and grocery stores provide thousands\\nof ready-made meals, frozen foods, and processed meals that require little\\npreparation at home.\\nTotal fat consumption in the United States increased from 18 percent\\nin 1977 to 38 percent in 1995. According to Lin and Frazao, away-from-\\nhome foods deliver more calories in fat and saturated fat and are lower in\\nfiber and calcium than home-cooked foods.

Since away-from-home foods deliver more fat and more calories, the\\ntrend of eating out can become a health hazard. People tend to eat more\\nfrom restaurants and fast-food places because many eating establishments\\n“supersize” their portions. Customers feel that they get their money’s worth\\nwhen they receive more food than they need.\\nInfluence of Diet on Health\\nChildhood and adulthood obesity are on the rise. Between 1988 and 1994,\\n11 percent of U.S. children and adolescents aged six to nine years of age\\nwere overweight or obese. During this same period, 35 percent of the\\nAmerican adult population aged twenty and over were obese, compared to\\n25 percent during the years 1976 through 1980. The rising trend in obe-\\nsity pervades the Middle East, the Caribbean, Europe, Latin America, Brazil,\\nJapan, South East Asia, Australia, and China.\\nSince being overweight is associated directly with many chronic ill-\\nnesses, such as heart disease , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , cancer,\\nstroke, and type II diabetes , an increase in the incidence of overweight\\nand obesity is a serious concern. The top three leading causes of death in\\nthe United States during the 1990s were heart disease, cancer, and stroke.\\nDiabetes ranked seventh in 1997—it was not even in the top ten in 1987.\\nThe U.S. Surgeon General reported in 1998 that type II diabetes, an adult\\nhealth problem related to obesity, was being seen in children as young as\\nfour years old. Diabetes among adults increased by 70 percent between 1990\\nand 1998 among individuals 30 to 39 years of age; by 41 percent among in-\\ndividuals 40 to 49; and by 31 percent among those 50 to 59. By 1998, 16\\nmillion American adults suffered from diabetes. In addition to the health\\nthreat, obesity can cause emotional pain due to social stigmatization, discrim-\\nination, and lowered self-esteem. In 2000, the World Health Organization\\nestimated that there are 1.2 billion obese individuals around the world.\\nFood Safety\\nThe increase in the number of fast-food restaurants, supermarkets, and\\nrestaurants in developing countries, and the rising trend of eating meals\\naway from home, present a global challenge to ensure that food is appeal-\\ning and safe. Many countries have agencies that set and regulate standards\\nfor food safety. In the United States, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\\n(USDA) has the task of regulating and inspecting meats and poultry during\\nslaughter and processing, while the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\\nis responsible for conducting tests, setting standards, and enforcing laws\\nregulating food quality and processing. FDA inspectors check restaurants\\nto make sure that they practice food safety regulations. FDA officials also\\nreview the safety of chemicals that manufacturers use as food additives .\\nImporting foods from countries where food safety is not strictly monitored\\npresents a global health threat.\\nThe biggest problem with food safety is food poisoning. Some bacte-\\nria and viruses that cause food poisoning are: Escherichia coli, Salmonella,\\nListeria monocytogenes, Shigella, Campylobacter, and yersinia. Bacteria, viruses,\\ntoxins, parasites, and chemical contaminants can all cause food-borne ill-\\nnesses, and it takes only a small amount of contaminated food to cause severe\\nfood illnesses.\\n164\\nDietary Trends, International\\nfast food: food requiring minimal prepa-\\nration before eating, or food delivered\\nvery quickly after ordering in a restaurant\\nobesity: the condition of being over-\\nweight, according to established norms\\nbased on sex, age, and height\\noverweight: weight above the accepted\\nnorm based on height, sex, and age\\nobese:above accepted standards of\\nweight for sex, height, and age\\nchronic: over a long period\\nheart disease: any disorder of the heart\\nor its blood supply, including heart attack,\\natherosclerosis, and coronary artery \\ndisease\\nhypertension: high blood pressure\\nhyperlipidemia: high levels of lipids (fats\\nor cholesterol) in the blood\\ncancer:uncontrolled cell growth\\nstroke: loss of blood supply to part of\\nthe brain, due to a blocked or burst\\nartery in the brain\\ntype II diabetes: Inability to regulate the\\nlevel of sugar in the blood due to a reduc-\\ntion in the number of insulin receptors on\\nthe body’s cells\\nincidence: number of new cases reported\\neach year\\nfood additive: substance added to foods\\nto improve nutrition, taste, appearance or\\nshelf-life\\nfood poisoning: illness caused by con-\\nsumption of spoiled food, usually contain-\\ning bacteria\\nbacteria: single-celled organisms without\\nnuclei, some of which are infectious\\nvirus: noncellular infectious agent that\\nrequires a host cell to reproduce\\ntoxins:poison\\nparasite: organism that feeds off of other\\norganisms'),\n",

Someone can be on a heart-\\nhealthy diet that encourages the consumption of reasonable amounts of\\nwhole grains and fresh fruits, vegetables, beans, and fish, but limits foods\\nhigh in saturated fat and sodium, or one can be on a weight loss diet.\\nExamples of weight loss diets include: the Atkins New Diet Revolution,\\nthe Calories Don’t Count Diet, the Protein Power Diet, the Carbohydrate\\nAddict’s Diet, and Weight Watchers. There is a lack of research, however,\\non whether these diets (except for Weight Watchers) are helpful, especially\\nover the long term (defined as two to five years from the date of weight\\nloss).\\nThe recommended approach to dieting for weight loss is to eat in\\nmoderation so as to control calories (do not go below 1,200 per day) and\\nto increase activity to lead to a gradual, safe weight loss. A recommended\\nmethod is to decrease calories each day by 125 (the amount in a small soft\\ndrink or full cup of juice) and to increase energy expenditure by 125 (walk-\\ning for about 30 minutes). That is, a 250-calorie deficit a day should result\\nin about a one- to two-pound weight loss over the course of a month. The\\ngoal is to slowly change eating and exercise routines and maintain a lifelong\\nhealthy weight. Quicker weight losses are hard to maintain. Most people\\ncan lose weight on any diet, even on fad diets, but the trick is to keep the\\nweight off.\\nSo-called fad diets are diets that come and go in the marketplace and\\nare typically deficient in various ways. For example, they may lack variety\\n(e.g., the Grapefruit Diet, the Cabbage Soup Diet), be too low in calories\\nand protein (the Rice Diet), and/or simply too bizarre (the Rotation Diet\\nfor food allergies). People should be especially wary of any “breakthrough”\\nquick-fix diets. If a diet sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\\nDelores Truesdell\\nBibliography\\nAlford, B. B.; Blankenship, A.

Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.\\nDigestion and Absorption\\nDigestion is the breakdown of food into smaller particles or individual nu-\\ntrients. It is accomplished through six basic processes, with the help of sev-\\neral body fluids—particularly digestive juices that are made up of compounds\\nsuch as saliva, mucus, enzymes, hydrochloric acid, bicarbonate, and bile.\\nThe six processes of digestion involve: (1) the movement of food and\\nliquids; (2) the lubrication of food with bodily secretions; (3) the mechani-\\ncal breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins; (4) the reabsorption of\\nnutrients—especially water; (5) the production of nutrients such as vitamin\\nK and biotinby friendly bacteria; and (6) the excretion of waste products.\\nComprehension of the tasks or processes needed to break down food are es-\\nsential to an understanding of how and when food really begins to function\\nwithin the body. For example, not understanding that carbohydrates break\\ndown into glucosecould lead one to believe that the best source of glucose\\nis in liquid form such as a soft drink. This could cause one to miss out on\\nthe nutrients (and great taste) in fruits, vegetables, and grains. Likewise, not\\nunderstanding the digestion process could lead a person to believe in the\\nmyth of “food combining,” or perhaps to think it is normal to be hungry\\nall the time. But, in fact, the digestive processes normal to human physiol-\\nogy can simultaneously handle carbohydrates, fats, and proteins—and allow\\npeople to go several hours between meals, especially if meals are balanced\\nin fiber and the individual nutrients needed.\\nGI Tract Physiology\\nDigestion begins in the mouth with the action of salivary amylase. The food\\nmaterial then progresses past the esophagus and into the stomach. A bolus\\n(soft mass) of chewed food moves by muscular wave actions, called peristalsis,\\nfrom the mouth to the pharynx, and then past the epiglottis that covers the\\nlarynx. The epiglottis closes off the air passage so that one doesn’t choke. The\\ncardiac sphincter prevents reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus.\\nFrom the Stomach to the Small Intestine\\nFood mixtures leaving the stomach are called chyme, and this empties into\\nthe small intestine after about two to four hours in the stomach.

A pyloric sphincter controls\\nthe rate of flow of chyme from the stomach into the small intestine.\\nMost digestion occurs in the upper portion of the small intestine, called\\nthe duodenum. Below the duodenum is the jejunum, and then there is the last\\nsegment, called the ileum. About 5 percent of undigested food products are\\nbroken down in the ileum. This is why some people can have a small part of\\ntheir intestine removed and still seem to digest most foods with little problem.\\nDigestion of food that enters the small intestine is usually complete af-\\nter three to ten hours. Once digestion is essentially finished, waste products\\nleave the ileum with the help of fiber, and these solids then enter the large\\nintestine (the colon). In the colon, water is reabsorbed; some nutrients are\\nproduced by friendly bacteria (vitamin K, biotin, vitamin B12); fibers are di-\\ngested to various acids and gases; and minerals, such as potassium and\\nsodium, are reabsorbed (when needed). Any fiber that is not broken down—\\nand small amounts of other undigested products—are excreted in the feces.\\nProtective Factors\\nDuring digestion in the stomach, large proteins break down into smaller\\nprotein forms, and harmful bacteria can become inactive. Hydrochloric acid\\nis especially important for this because it lowers the pH of the stomach con-\\ntents below 2. Along with the uncoiling of protein in the stomach, a little\\ncarbohydrate and lipid are broken down with the help of enzymes (called\\namylaseand lipase, respectively).\\nIn the stomach, carbohydrates in foods turn to starch, but it is not un-\\ntil the chyme reaches the small intestine and becomes more neutralized that\\nstarch turns to simple sugars that are then absorbed into the portal vein,\\nwhich transports them to the liver. Also in the small intestine, lipids (mostly\\nin the form of triglycerides) are emulsified and form monoglycerides and\\nfree fatty acids that can then go through the lymph system to the heart\\nand bloodstream.\\nAs previously mentioned, the mouth, stomach, small intestine, and colon\\nare the major organs of digestion. However, the liver, gallbladder, and pan-\\ncreas are also important to the process. The liver detoxifies foreign com-\\npounds, such as natural toxicants in foods and drugs. The liver also makes\\nbile, an emulsifier, which enters the small intestine and prepares fats and\\noils for digestion. This bile is stored in the gallbladder prior to delivery to\\nthe small intestine. A hormone called cholecystokinin helps control the re-\\nlease of bile.\\nThe pancreas makes pancreatic juice consisting of enzymes (amylases,\\nlipases, and proteases) and bicarbonate, which helps neutralize acidic secre-\\ntions produced during digestion.

Most of the end-products of digestion,\\nalong with vitamins, minerals, and water, are absorbed in the small intesti-\\nnal lumen by four mechanisms for absorption: (1) active transport, (2) pas-\\nsive diffusion, (3) endocytosis, and (4) facilitative diffusion. Active transport\\nrequires energy.\\nNutrient absorption is efficient because the GI tract is folded with sev-\\neral surfaces for absorption and these surfaces are lined with villi (hairlike\\nprojections) and microvilli cells. As one nutrition textbook puts it, each per-\\nson has a surface area “equivalent to the surface of a tennis court” packed\\ninto his or her gut (Insel et al., p. 81). Efficient absorption can be compro-\\nmised due to lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance is not uncommon in\\nthe world, affecting about 25 percent of the U.S. population and 75 percent\\nof the worldwide population. It is usually due to the lack or absence of the\\nenzyme lactase, which breaks down milk sugar.\\nLactose intolerance is not a food allergy. Food allergies are serious,\\neven life threatening, but most people with lactose intolerance can digest\\nsmall amounts of milk, especially in yogurt and cheese.\\nProtein, carbohydrate, lipid, and most vitamin absorption occur in the\\nsmall intestine. Once proteins are broken down by proteases they are ab-\\nsorbed as dipeptides, tripeptides, and individual amino acids . Carbohy-\\ndrates, including both sugar and starch molecules, are broken down by\\nenzymes in the intestine to disaccharides called sucrose, lactose, and maltose,\\nand then finally into the end-products known as glucose, fructose, and galactose,\\nwhich are absorbed mostly by active transport. Lipase, an enzyme in the\\npancreas and the small intestine, and bile from the liver, break down lipids\\ninto fatty acids and monglycerides; these end-products then are absorbed\\nthrough villi cells as triglycerides.\\nAlcohol is not a nutrient, but 80 percent of consumed alcohol is ab-\\nsorbed in the small intestine. The other 20 percent is absorbed into the\\nstomach. Alcohol is absorbed by simple diffusion, which explains why gas-\\ntric ulcers are not uncommon in people who drink excessively.\\nCoordination and Transport of Nutrients into the Blood \\nor to the Heart\\nHormones and the nervous system coordinate digestion and absorption.\\nThe presence of food, or the thought or smell of food, can cause a positive\\nresponse from these systems. Factors that can inhibit digestion include\\nstress, cold foods, and bacteria.\\nAfter foods are digested and nutrients are absorbed, they are trans-\\nported to specific places throughout the body. Water-soluble nutrients\\nleave the GI tract in the blood and travel via the portal vein, first to the\\nliver and then to the heart. Unlike the vascular system for water-soluble\\nnutrients, the lymphatic system has no pump for fat-soluble nutrients;\\ninstead, these nutrients eventually enter the vascular system, though they\\nbypass the activity of the liver at first.

Examples of disasters include hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earth-\\nquakes, drought, blizzards, famine, war, fire, volcanic eruption, a building\\ncollapse, or a transportation wreck. When any such disaster strikes, a vari-\\nety of international organizations offer relief to the affected country. Each\\norganization has different objectives, expertise, and resources to offer, and\\nseveral hundred may become involved in a single major disaster. Interna-\\ntional disaster relief on such a large scale must be properly coordinated to\\navoid further chaos and confusion both during and after the disaster.\\nAssessment\\nIn the event of a disaster, the government of the affected country must con-\\nduct a needs assessmentto determine what emergency supplies and per-\\nsonnel are required. These needs should be communicated to those relief\\norganizations that will potentially provide assistance. The process of re-\\nquesting and receiving supplies is lengthy and includes many events that\\ncould delay the arrival of assistance. Requests for assistance must first be re-\\nviewed and approved by relief organizations, and then supplies and person-\\nnel must be collected and transported to the disaster site. Effective\\nmanagement of relief assistance depends on anticipating and identifying\\nproblems, and on delivering specific supplies and personnel at the times and\\nplaces they are needed.\\nHealth Risks\\nDisasters often pose significant health threats. One of the most serious con-\\ncerns after a disaster, especially a natural disaster, is sanitation. Disruptions\\nin water supplies and sewage systems can pose serious health risks to vic-\\ntims because they decrease the amount and quality of available drinking\\nwater and create difficulties in waste disposal. Drinking water can be cont-\\naminated by breaks in sewage lines or the presence of animal cadavers in\\nwater sources. These factors can facilitate the spread of disease after a dis-\\naster. Providing potable drinking water to victims and adopting alternative\\nmethods of sanitation must be a priority after a disaster.\\nFood shortages are often an immediate health consequence of disasters.\\nExisting food stocks may be destroyed or disruptions to distribution systems\\nmay prevent the delivery of food. In these situations, food relief programs\\nshould include the following elements: (1) assessment of food supplies avail-\\nable after the disaster, (2) determination of the nutritional needs of victims,\\n(3) calculation of daily food needs, and (4) surveillance of victims’ nutritional\\n173\\nDisaster Relief Organizations\\nfamine: extended period of food shortage\\nneeds assessment: formal procedure\\nfor determining needs\\npotable: safe to drink'),\n",

Some populations are particularly susceptible to malnutrition, such\\nas children under five years of age and pregnant women. In addition to\\nfood, th ese populations should be given nutritional supplements whenever\\npossible.\\nAfter a disaster, victims must be protected from hazardous climatic con-\\nditions, such as severe temperatures or precipitation. People should be kept\\ndry, reasonably well clothed, and able to access emergency shelter.\\nDisasters can also cause disruptions to the health care infrastructure.\\nHospitals and health centers may suffer structural damage, or health per-\\nsonnel may be among the casualties, limiting the ability to provide health\\nservices to disaster victims. Emergency Health Kits that contain essential\\nmedical supplies and drugs are often provided to victims as part of the\\nimmediate response to disasters. Developed through the collaboration of\\nvarious relief organizations, these kits are designed to meet the primary\\nhealth care needs of people without access to medical facilities. Each kit\\ncovers the needs of about 10,000 persons for three months, at a cost of about\\nfifty cents per person. The twelve essential drugs in the basic kit include\\nanti-inflammatories, an antacid, a disinfectant, oral dehydration salts, an\\nantimalarial, a basic antibiotic (effective against the most common bacte-\\nria), and an ointment for eye infections. These medicines can treat the most\\ncommon illnesses of disaster victims, such as anemia, pain, diarrhea, fever,\\nrespiratory tract infections, eye and ear infections, measles, and skin condi-\\ntions.

Although deviant eat-\\ning patterns have been reported throughout history, eating disorders were\\nfirst identified as medical conditions by the British physician William Gull\\nin 1873. The incidence of eating disorders increased substantially through-\\nout the twentieth century, and in 1980 the American Psychiatric Associa-\\ntion formally classified these conditions as mental illnesses.\\nDiagnosis\\nIndividuals with eating disorders are obsessed with food, body image, and\\nweight loss. They may have severely limited food choices, employ bizarre\\neating rituals, excessively drink fluids and chew gum, and avoid eating with\\nothers. Depending on the severity and duration of their illness, they may\\ndisplay physical symptoms such as weight loss; amenorrhea; loss of inter-\\nest in sex; low blood pressure; depressed body temperature; chronic, un-\\nexplained vomiting; and the growth of soft, fine hair on the body and face.\\n176\\nEating Disorders\\nE\\nincidence: number of new cases reported\\neach year\\nritual: ceremony or frequently repeated\\nbehavior\\namenorrhea: lack of menstruation\\nblood pressure: measure of the pres-\\nsure exerted by the blood against the\\nwalls of the blood vessels\\nchronic: over a long period'),\n",

They are classified into four\\ndistinct diagnostic categories by the American Psychiatric Association:\\nanorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and eating dis-\\norder not otherwise specified.\\nAnorexia nervosa. Clinically, anorexia nervosa is diagnosed as inten-\\ntional weight loss of 15 percent or more of normal body weight. The\\nanorexic displays an inordinate fear of weight gain or becoming fat, even\\nthough he or she may be extremely thin. Food intake is strictly limited, of-\\nten to the point of life-threatening starvation. Sufferers may be unaware of\\nor in denial of their weight loss, and may therefore resist treatment.\\nPeak ages of onset are between 12 and 13 and at age 17. Among women\\nof menstruating age, menstruation ceases due to weight-related declines in\\nfemale hormones.\\nThis illness has two subtypes: the restricting type, in which weight loss\\nis achieved solely via reduction in food intake, and the binge eating/purging\\ntype, in which anorexic behavior is accompanied by recurrent episodes of\\nbinge eating or purging.\\nBulimia nervosa. Bulimia nervosa is characterized by repeated episodes\\nof bingeing followed by compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain.\\nCompensatory behaviors include vomiting, diuretic and laxative abuse, fast-\\ning, or excessive exercise. Like the anorexic, the typical bulimic has an un-\\nusual concern about body weight and weight loss. Unlike the anorexic, he\\nor she is acutely aware of this condition and has a greater sense of guilt and\\nloss of self control.\\nBulimia typically develops during the late teens and early twenties. In con-\\ntrast to the typically emaciated anorexic, most bulimics are of normal body\\nweight, although weight may fluctuate frequently. Physically, the bulimic may\\nhave symptoms such as erosion of tooth enamel, swollen salivary glands, potas-\\nsium depletion, bruised knuckles, and irritation of the esophagus.\\nTo qualify for a clinical diagnosis of bulimia nervosa, binge eating and\\nrelated compensatory behaviors must take place at least two times a week\\nfor a minimum of three months. Sufferers are classified into one of two sub-\\ntypes: the purging type,which employs laxatives, diuretics, or self-induced\\nvomiting to compensate for bingeing, or the nonpurging type, which relies\\non behaviors such as excessive exercising or fasting to offset binges.\\nBinge eating disorder. Binge eating disorder is characterized by eating\\nbinges that are not followed by compensatory methods. This condition,\\nwhich frequently appears in late adolescence or the early twenties, affects\\nbetween 15 and 50 percent of individuals participating in diet programs and\\noften develops after substantial diet-related weight loss. Of those affected,\\n50 percent are male.\\nBinge eating disorder is diagnosed when an individual recurrently (at least\\ntwice a week for a six month period) indulges in bingeing behavior. A clini-\\ncal diagnosis also requires three or more of the following behaviors: (1) eat-\\ning at an unusually rapid pace, (2) eating until uncomfortably full, (3) eating\\nlarge quantities of food in the absence of physical hunger, (4) eating alone out\\n177\\nEating Disorders\\npsychological: related to thoughts, feel-\\nings, and personal experiences\\nbehavioral: related to behavior, in con-\\ntrast to medical or other types of inter-\\nventions\\nanorexia nervosa: refusal to maintain\\nbody weight at or above what is consid-\\nered normal for height and age\\nbulimia: uncontrolled episodes of eating\\n(bingeing) usually followed by self-induced\\nvomiting (purging)\\nbinge: uncontrolled indulgence\\neating disorder: behavioral disorder in-\\nvolving excess consumption, avoidance\\nof consumption, self-induced vomiting, or\\nother food-related aberrant behavior\\nhormone: molecules produced by one\\nset of cells that influence the function of\\nanother set of cells\\ndiuretic: substance that depletes the\\nbody of water')]"
